jobs,Almost half of all Americans work in low-wage jobs,America's unemployment rate is at a half-century low. but it also has a job-quality problem that affects nearly half the population. with a study finding 44% of U.S. workers are employed in low-wage jobs that pay median annual wages of $18.000.Contrary to popular opinion. these workers aren't teenagers or young adults just starting their careers. write Martha Ross and Nicole Bateman of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. which conducted the analysis.

Their median hourly wage is $10.22 per hour — that's above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour but well below what's considered the living wage for many regions.Even though the economy is adding more jobs. there's increasing evidence that many of those new positions don't offer the kind of wages and benefits required to get ahead.

jobs,Germany's car jobs boom comes to a screeching halt,After a week in which Daimler AG and Audi announced thousands of job cuts. it's easy to forget that the German car industry once seemed unassailable.The 2009 recession forced a massive downsizing of America's auto giants. General Motors and Chrysler Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; Ford Motor Co. escaped a similar fate only by cutting its work force to the bone. By contrast. Volkswagen. BMW AG and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz overcame the crisis with barely a scratch. Afterward. they took full advantage as wealthy Chinese splurged on luxury German vehicles. Germany's carmakers and their suppliers went on a hiring spree at home and abroad.There were early signs of hubris: Volkswagen paid its CEO 17.5 million euros ($19.3 million) in 2011. But Germany's powerful trade unions made sure workers benefited too. In recent years. production line staff at BMW and Porsche subsidiary took home almost 10.000 euros as an annual bonus. BMW spends an average of roughly $11.000 per employee on salary. pension and social security costs. according to its annual report.Now that jobs boom has come to a screeching halt. and not before time. An industry facing unprecedented upheaval can't afford such largess.

But Treasury market participants are also probably wishing for a little more conviction in their next steps.U.S. government debt has found its steadiest footing in months. with the 10-year yield trading in a narrow range and stabilizing around 1.78%. This owes a lot to the cheerful sentiment in U.S. equities -- which hit record highs in November despite persistent uncertainty over trade talks -- and signs of stabilization in economic data. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently detailed his view of U.S. growth as a glass more than half-full. But that doesn’t mean Treasury investors have abandoned their customary glass-half-empty perspective.“We still feel that we’re on the right side of this. in the sense that we’re quite miserable with regard to the economic outlook.” said James Athey. a London-based portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Even so. he’s sticking to the two-year sector and positioning for a steeper yield curve to keep “a foot in either camp” in case of positive surprises.

Though remote work may be the accommodation that keeps you in the workforce. it’s important to talk about some of the harder aspects of working from home too.Mighty contributor Ruthy Websdale outlined in her article. “Working From Home Because of My Disability Is No Vacation.” that while virtual employment is a boost for self-care and eliminating travel. there are two emotional aspects she has to keep in mind. This includes feeling isolated from co-workers and feeling at times like you don’t fit in. Websdale wrote:It can be massively isolating working from home. It’s easy to think it’d be bliss to be alone and not deal with people face-to-face. but there’s a difference when it’s by necessity rather than choice. I’m a pretty happily introverted person. but the lack of social interaction when you spend all day in a home office is tough. You miss out on easy networking. work friends. casual meetings and even being able to interpret body language.If you’re struggling with feeling disconnected or lonely without co-workers in the next cubicle over. know you’re not alone.

Wisconsin’s job market has recovered. according to a new report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum.The shift in the state’s job market is largely due to an increase in higher-paying jobs that require more education. but this shift isn’t happening throughout the state.

jobs,Jobs report. manufacturing data — What to know in the week ahead,Economic data this week will play a crucial role in determining the Fed’s next move on December 11. Two big economic reports will be on investor’s radars this week — the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing survey and the November employment report.November’s ISM manufacturing report is scheduled to be released shortly after the market open Monday. After a few months of being in contractionary territory. most economists do not expect the ISM manufacturing index to deteriorate further so long as the trade war does escalate further.“Regional surveys have broadly improved. and we expect headline ISM to recover above 50 in the next few months. Despite some recovery. we do not expect manufacturing surveys to pick up robustly.” Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Profits growth has slowed. global growth has been sluggish. and trade uncertainty is likely to linger even if US-China negotiations yield a tentative deal.”Capital Economics echoed Credit Suisse’s sentiment. “Helped by the pause in trade tensions. global conditions appear to be stabilizing. the dollar has been broadly stable in trade-weighted terms. and the drop in interest rates is starting to feed through. Putting that all together. we expect the ISM manufacturing index to rebound to 50.0 in November. from 48.3. That would be a sign that manufacturing output is not falling off a cliff. But we don’t expect it to mark the beginning of a game-changing recovery. either. with manufacturing conditions likely to remain subdued in 2020.”

She assists physicians as they repair hernias. operate on cataracts and fix injured knees. She comforts the fearful. She coaches medical students on how to scrub their hands.And. after 13 years on the job. Torres makes a decent wage: $29.72 an hour plus benefits. “It’s amazing to work at such a prestigious place.” she says. “When I got hired there. I was so proud.”So what was Torres doing on a November picket line. swinging a sign reading. “Inequality Hurts Patient Care.” and chanting. “Hey-hey. ho-ho. UC greed has got to go”?The University of California is at war with its largest union. the 26.000-member Local 3299 of the American Federation of State. County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). November’s one-day strike. with picket lines at 10 UC campuses and five university hospitals across the state. was the sixth such angry walkout in the three years that the two sides have been fighting over a new contract.The issue is outsourcing: the sprawling university system’s use of workers from temporary help agencies and staffing firms to fill low- and middle-wage service and healthcare jobs.

CEO Rob Peabody revealed on a conference call Monday to discuss guidance for 2020 and 2021.The Calgary-based company had refused previously to say how many workers were affected by job cuts designed to better align its workforce with lower capital spending plans going forward."What we're seeing is that (the reductions) will generate forward savings of about $70 million." said Peabody. adding the company will take a charge against earnings of $70 million in the fourth quarter to account for the job cuts."We're going to continue those efforts to capitalize on the fact we've created a more focused and a simpler company."In a regulatory filing earlier this year. Husky indicated it had 5.157 permanent employees at the end of 2018. little changed from the numbers at the end of 2016 and 2017.Capital spending for 2020 and 2021 is being cut by $500 million compared with guidance released last spring due to what Husky called changing market conditions.
jobs,8 Nebraska State Fair workers lose jobs amid restructuring,GRAND ISLAND — Eight full-time employees at the Nebraska State Fair have lost their jobs.The workers were fired last week as fair officials restructure the organization amid financial problems.State Fair Executive Direc tor Lori Cox says the restructuring will save about $520.000 in personnel costs.Before the firings. the fair employed 17 full-time workers and one part-timer.Cox says the smaller full-time payroll reflects that the fair is an “11-day operation” rather than a year-round operation.Television station NTV reported that among the employees to lose their jobs were Lori Arterburn. the fair's financial controller; Chelsey Jungck. chief of events; and Bill Angell. livestock division director.
jobs,USC VP becoming two jobs; both cut from Feb. elections,The jobs that run Western’s student government have changed substantially. after the USC added a new executive student role while also cutting back the election to just the president.The University Students’ Council has split its vice-presidency in two: the role currently fulfilled by Cat Dunne has been divvied between its on-campus and off-campus work. Currently. the second-in-command executive will on some days lobby the provincial government. and on others draft policies with the university.But neither of the VP internal or external roles will stand in February’s general election. While Dunne was elected in a two-candidate slate with president Bardia Jalayer. next year’s VPs will be hired by councillors after the president is elected alone.Other executives are elected this way; the councillors also each represent a faculty. and are elected by students in that faculty.The change comes as the most recent to a government structure that is frequently redrawn by students who come and go every handful of years. And this blueprint. while largely strengthening the government. also slims down students’ choice in February to the president and their councillors.
jobs,UK manufacturers cut jobs at fastest rate since 2012 - PMI,LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers cut jobs last month at the fastest rate since 2012. a survey showed on Monday. as pressures from Brexit and a global trade slowdown caused the sector’s longest decline since the financial crisis.The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) sank to 48.9 in November from 49.6 in October. a slightly smaller decline than an initial flash estimate of 48.3.But the PMI stuck below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction for a seventh consecutive month. the longest such run since 2009. as the country headed for an early election on Dec. 12 intended to end a parliamentary logjam over Brexit.“November saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place. as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election.” IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.

technology,TikTok sent US user data to China. lawsuit claims,Video-sharing app TikTok has been hit with a class action lawsuit in the US that claims it transferred "vast quantities" of user data to China.The lawsuit accuses the company of "surreptitiously" taking content without user consent.Owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. TikTok has built up a keen US fan base.TikTok. which is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide. has previously said it does not store US data on Chinese servers.However. the platform is facing mounting pressure in North America over data collection and censorship concerns.The lawsuit filed in a Californian court last week claims TikTok "clandestinely... vacuumed up and transferred to servers in China vast quantities of private and personally-identifiable user data".It alleges the data could be used to identify. profile and track users in the US "now and in the future".
technology,FaceApp may pose 'counterintelligence threat' says FBI,The FBI said FaceApp and other mobile applications developed in Russia pose a "potential counterintelligence threat".The comments were made in a letter to US Senator Chuck Schumer after he called for an investigation into the app.The face-editing tool went viral earlier this year but prompted privacy concerns.The FBI comments come amid rising US concern that products made by foreign tech firms could pose security risks.In a letter addressed to Mr Schumer. the agency said "it considers any mobile application or similar product developed in Russia. such as FaceApp. to be a potential counterintelligence threat".The FBI also said it would act if it found any evidence of foreign political meddling through the application. which alters users' photos to make them look older or younger.FaceApp did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The app was developed by Wireless Lab. a company based in St Petersburg. The company previously said it does not permanently store images. and does not collect troves of data - only uploading specific photos selected by users for editing.
technology,General election 2019: Parties splurge on Facebook ads,The political parties' Facebook ads campaigns had been lively enough since the general election was called a few weeks ago - but suddenly over the weekend they caught fire.On Sunday. the Conservatives unleashed a tidal wave of adverts. Their two themes were getting Brexit done. and improving the NHS.At one point. the Facebook Ad Library showed that about 2.500 adverts paid for by the Conservative Party were live.The Liberal Democrats appear to be on an even bigger splurge. The last time I looked they had about 3.000 adverts running. many of them with an image of Boris Johnson.The message was that only a vote for them could "stop Boris".By contrast. while Labour has spent heavily over the last seven days. the library currently shows only 250 Facebook ads running at the moment. many with a message promising cheaper rail travel.Many of these thousands of ads look identical when listed in the library - the claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built appears on hundreds of the Conservative adverts. and a Liberal Democrat message proclaiming "You Can Stop Boris Johnson" is repeated again and again.

technology,Amazon's AI musical keyboard 'sounds terrible',Amazon has unveiled a musical keyboard with a built-in artificial intelligence (AI) composer.The AWS DeepComposer is a two-octave. 32-key keyboard that can connect to computers via a USB cable.Users can play a short tune. or use a pre-recorded one. ask the keyboard to embellish it in one of four styles - jazz. classical. rock or pop - and then publish it on Soundcloud.But one expert said the audio demo provided by Amazon was "terrible".Prof Nick Collins. an expert on musical AI at Durham University. admitted it was difficult to evaluate the quality of DeepComposer based on the single audio example provided by Amazon in a blog."If I had to judge just based on what was on that web page. I wasn't very impressed at all." he told the BBC.
technology,Apple Pay speeds up payments on the Tube,Apple has tweaked its Apple Pay service in an effort to reduce queues at London Tube-station barriers.The Express Transit feature means commuters will experience shorter payment times when they tap in to the Tube using their iPhone or Apple Watch.It works by doing away with the need to authenticate payments via face recognition or a fingerprint scan.The move brings Apple Pay into line with Android Pay. which already allows commuters to simply tap in and out.The Express Transit feature will work on iPhone SE. 6S and later models as well as the Apple Watch.By designating a specific bank card to be their travel payment card. owners of these devices won't need to authenticate transactions as they enter and exit the Tube system any more.Instead of a bank card. users can also designate their Citymapper Pass - a virtual travel card available on a subscription. starting at £30 per week.
technology,Android 'spoofing' bug helps targets bank accounts,A "major" security weakness in Google's Android software has let cyber-thieves craft apps that can steal banking logins. a security firm has found.The bug lets attackers create fake login screens that can be inserted into legitimate apps to harvest data.More than 60 financial institutions have been targeted by the technique. a survey of the Play store indicated.Google said it had taken action to close the loophole and was keen to find out more about its origins."It targeted several banks in several countries and the malware successfully exploited end users to steal money." said Tom Hansen. chief technology officer of Norwegian mobile security firm Promon. which found the bug.The problem emerged after Promon analysed malicious apps that had been spotted draining bank accounts.Called Strandhogg. the vulnerability can be used to trick users into thinking they are using a legitimate app but are actually clicking on an overlay created by the attackers.
technology,These posh ride-sharing startups aim to leave Uber and Lyft in the dust,I'm running late for dinner in Hamburg. Germany. with no time to walk or take the bus. Time to fire up a ride-sharing app. But rather than Uber or Lyft. I quickly open an app called Moia. It tells me to cross the street and my driver will arrive in nine minutes. Right on time. a big. golden van pulls up in front of me. and the side door opens. "Shara?" the driver says as I take a seat in a sleek cream-colored seat and take in my surroundings.The roomy interior is softly lit by white lights on the ceiling. almost making it feel like the vehicle has no roof. I lean back against the wide headrest that shelters my face from the other rider in the vehicle. A monitor hanging in front of me says I'll be at my destination in 15 minutes. right after we drop off my fellow passenger and pick up another. While this sounds like a normal -- albeit premium -- shared ride service. Moia. which launched in Hanover in July 2018 and expanded into Hamburg six months ago. is run by Volkswagen.Moia is just one of several new services that have emerged over the past few years to tap into demand for environmentally friendly and comfortable transportation. Its rival. CleverShuttle operates in six German cities. though it recently left three others. including Hamburg. UFODrive started 18 months ago in Luxembourg to give people an option for quickly renting electric vehicles through a smartphone app. and numerous scooter and biking companies -- from Bird to Uber's Jump -- have all but taken over cities across the globe. In many ways. Moia resembles an Uber Pool or Lyft Line shared ride: I hail a vehicle through an  app. setting my pickup location and destination. The app sends me the offered price for the ride. gives me an estimated arrival time. and tells me where and when to meet my driver. 
technology,Twitter launches privacy center to explain what it's actually doing with your data,The privacy center is meant to be an accountability tool. according to Twitter.Twitter on Monday launched a privacy center. admitting it has "room for improvement" when it comes to protecting user privacy. The Twitter Privacy Center plans to spell out more clearly what the social media giant is doing to safeguard the information users share with the site. Twitter also said in a series of tweets that it's updating its terms and privacy policy. which go into effect Jan. 1. "We believe companies should be accountable to the people that trust them with their personal information. and responsible not only to protect that information but to explain how they do it." according to a company blog post.The privacy center is designed to be a home base that hosts information about privacy-related initiatives. announcements. new privacy products. communication about security incidents. and more. 
technology,Mark Zuckerberg: People should make their own judgments on political ads,Facebook has faced repeated criticism for its policy against fact-checking advertisements from politicians. but CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again defending the social network's decision. In an interview that aired Monday. Zuckerberg said that it's important for people to judge for themselves what politicians are saying. "What I believe is that in a democracy. it's really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying. so they can make their own judgments." Zuckerberg told CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King. "And. you know. I don't think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news." (Editors' note: CNET is owned by CBS.)Zuckerberg has been defending the social network's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech and combating misinformation amid elections. Facebook faces mounting pressure to do more to stop misinformation. hate speech and other offensive content on the world's largest social network. which has nearly 2.5 billion users. Criticism about the company's hands-off approach to political ads heightened in October after Facebook rejected a request by Joe Biden's presidential campaign to remove an ad by Donald Trump's reelection campaign because it contains misinformation about the former vice president. The Trump ad included a 30-second video that said Biden had promised Ukraine $1 billion if officials in that country fired the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with Biden's son. a claim that has been been debunked by fact-checking groups and media reports.
technology,NASA is going to shoot an asteroid and Europe will examine the mess,Europe and the US are joining forces to save the world from an apocalyptic asteroid impact. Or at least to start the process of learning how we might prevent Armageddon by crashing a spacecraft into a binary asteroid.The European Space Agency has gotten approval from the continent's space leaders to build and launch the Hera asteroid mission as soon as 2024. Hera will visit the double asteroid Didymos to scope out its smaller component. informally called "Didymoon." a few years after NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft has collided with it.The hope is Didymoon will become the first natural object in the solar system to have its orbit shifted by human effort enough to measure the difference.Didymoon is 525 feet (160 meters) across. or about the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. and it orbits the half-mile-wide (780-meter) main body of Didymos.Currently. NASA's DART is slated to launch aboard a SpaceX rocket in mid-2021 and smash into Didymoon by the end of 2022. Hera would then launch in 2024 and arrive to check out DART's work in 2026. Hera will gather images and reams of data from Didymos to relay back to Earth. and also will release a pair of cubesats that'll fly closer and eventually land on the asteroid.The hope is that all this will result in a better understanding of how we might one day be able to deflect a dangerous asteroid without having to sacrifice Bruce Willis. (Sorry for the 20-year-old spoiler.)
technology,SpaceX CRS-19 mission: How to watch Falcon 9 launch to the space station,SpaceX rocket launches are happening so often they seem like fairly routine affairs now -- but they're still must-watch events. A brand-new Falcon 9 booster is scheduled to launch a Dragon capsule. carrying scientific payloads and a handful of CubeSats for NASA. direct to the International Space Station. from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral. Florida.The mission. known as CRS-19. will be the 19th resupply voyage for SpaceX and the third time this particular Dragon capsule is headed to space.The launch window opens no earlier than 12:51 p.m. ET (9:51 a.m. PT) on Dec. 4 and SpaceX usually broadcasts all of its launches live. with coverage to start about 15 minutes prior to lift-off. You can also keep your eyes glued to the SpaceX Twitter account for updates. Weather was 90% favorable when assessed on Dec. 1.The Falcon 9 booster will return to Earth to be reused in subsequent missions by SpaceX. while the Dragon capsule starts its journey to the ISS. SpaceX's previous launch knocked down two more recycling milestones. including reusing a Falcon 9 booster and sticking the landing for a fourth time. That landing took place on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship and the same capture is expected during this mission. 
technology,Goo Hara and the trauma of South Korea's spy cam victims,When K-pop star Goo Hara. who died last week. was secretly filmed by a boyfriend. she publicly fought for justice. For this. she was viciously attacked online. The sentences for so-called "spy cam porn" are relatively lenient in South Korea. but as the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul writes. their victims can face a different kind of punishment."I feel like he's still watching me." Eun-ju Lee told her dad.It was around 1am. and she had called her dad yet again after waking in terror from another nightmare.A few days later she would take her own life.Eun-ju. not her real name. was a victim of South Korea's so called spy camera epidemic. Her colleague at a major hospital in the south of the country had drilled a hole to place a tiny camera in one of the ladies changing rooms. When he was caught upskirting a woman. police seized his phone and found illicit footage of four victims.Her parents played me a phone call Eun-ju had made in her final days. which they believe shows the effect this had on their daughter's mental health.She had accidentally run into the culprit on her way to the hospital. In a panic she phoned the hospital's union representative who taped the call. She appears unable to breathe and her voice is barely audible.
technology,How to make phone batteries that last longer,When Professor Akira Yoshino was developing a new battery technology in his laboratory in the early 1980s. he didn't think it would amount to much."At the time. we thought it mainly would be used in 8mm video cameras." he laughs.He was well off the mark. These days you are never more than a few feet away from a lithium-ion battery. as they power mobile phones and all sorts of other electronics. from toothbrushes to electric scooters.In recognition of that success. Prof Yoshino was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.But despite improvements. even the most advanced lithium-ion batteries can only store a fraction of the energy of a similar weight of petrol or jet fuel.And that is curbing ambitions for even smaller and lighter devices - and more ambitious projects like electric powered aviation.Batteries need to make progress. admits Prof Yoshino. but thankfully. "there's a lot of interesting approaches".And "the solid state battery. I think. is a promising one." he says.
technology,How China-US rivalry is dividing the internet,When Hyunjin Seo visited Beijing in July last year. she scrolled through Google News on her smartphone and discovered several reports about an attack on the city's US embassy.An associate professor at the University of Kansas's journalism department. she bypassed China's strict digital media censors thanks to the roaming plan of her US phone firm. This allowed her to access websites such as those from Google not available in China."I was telling my Chinese friends about the bomb detonating outside the [US] embassy and they didn't know what I was talking about. because this news wasn't appearing in their search feeds." recalls Prof Seo. who teaches courses on digital media.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade. tech. defence and soft power.Her experience is common for any westerner visiting China.The internet in the world's most populous country is heavily restricted and censored. leading experts to speculate that in the future there could be two distinct internets - one led by China and one by the US.
technology,TikTok prevented disabled users’ videos from showing up in feeds,Social video network TikTok apparently limited the reach of people with disabilities. including facial disfigurement and Down syndrome. According to Netzpolitik.org. which spoke with a source inside the company. the policy was supposed to protect users with a high risk of bullying. In practice. however. it apparently amounted to discrimination — and the problem was compounded by moderators who needed to make snap decisions about users’ physical and mental traits.TikTok fame relies heavily on getting content promoted through TikTok’s algorithm. But Netzpolitik.org’s source alleges that TikTok made this difficult for people who might be bullied. One risk category meant that videos only appeared in the country where they were uploaded. Another. known as “Auto R.” stopped videos from hitting other users’ “For You” feed after hitting a certain view count. This tag might be applied to individual videos. but for a couple of dozen “special users.” it was supposedly the default.“Auto R” seemingly applied to a broad category of people. It could cover disabilities like the ones mentioned above. but Netzpolitik.org describes TikTok limiting the reach of “fat and self-confident” users. LGBT users. or users with autism — in other words. categories of people particularly likely to face abuse online. As the article notes. though. these categories could be difficult to judge simply from profiles or videos. And while the policy was meant to prevent bullying. it did so by punishing the likely victims.
technology,The ‘Amazon effect’ is flooding a struggling recycling system with cardboard,This holiday season. the popularity of online shopping collides with upheaval in cardboard recycling. China’s 2017 decision to turn away America’s trash has left the recycling industry reeling as it figures out what to do with all the packaging online shoppers leave behind.Some municipal recycling programs have closed. Even the ones that haven’t still have headaches: specifically. filthy recyclables. All of that leads to more cardboard in landfills.The rise in curbside cardboard waste coming from packaging is “the Amazon effect.” says David Biderman. the executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America. an industry group. It peaks around the holidays — particularly as online shopping has only gotten more popular. Last year. Cyber Monday was the biggest shopping day for Amazon in the history of the company. The trend extends beyond the holidays: US Postal Service deliveries have doubled to 6.2 billion in 2018. from 3.1 billion in 2009.As Americans have gotten more enthusiastic about online shopping. China — which once welcomed almost half the world’s recyclables — has gotten more stringent about what it will accept. Starting in January 2018. China stopped accepting shipments of cardboard that are contaminated with more than 0.5 percent of other materials.
technology,AWS launches Braket. its quantum computing service,While Google. Microsoft. IBM and others have made a lot of noise around their quantum computing efforts in recent months. AWS remained quiet. The company. after all. never had its own quantum research division. Today. though. AWS announced the preview launch of Braket (named after the common notation for quantum states). its own quantum computing service. It’s not building its own quantum computer. though. Instead. it’s partnering with D-Wave. IonQ and Rigetti and making their systems available through its cloud. In addition. it’s also launching the AWS Center for Quantum Computing and AWS Quantum Solutions Lab.With Braket. developers can get started on building quantum algorithms and basic applications and then test them in simulations on AWS. as well as the quantum hardware from its partners. That’s a smart move on AWS’s part. as it’s hedging its bets without incurring the cost of trying to build a quantum computer itself. And for its partners. AWS provides them with the kind of reach that would be hard to achieve otherwise. Developers and researchers. on the other hand. get access to all of these tools through a single interface. making it easier for them to figure out what works best for them.“By collaborating with AWS. we will be able to deliver access to our systems to a much broader market and help accelerate the growth of this emerging industry.” said Chad Rigetti. founder and CEO of Rigetti Computing .D-Wave offered a similar statement. “D-Wave’s quantum systems and our Leap cloud environment were both purpose-built to make practical application development a reality today and. in turn. fuel real-world business advantage for our customers.” said D-Wave’s chief product officer and EVP of R&D. Alan Baratz. “Amazon’s Braket will open the door to more smart developers who will build the quantum future. and the forward-thinking executives who will transform industries.”

technology,Mass media vs. social media,In the waning years of the last millennium. at my university. one of the cause célèbres of the progressive left was a concept known as “Manufacturing Consent.” the title of a book and film. by and starring Noam Chomsky. Its central thesis was that US mass media “are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function. by reliance on market forces. internalized assumptions. and self-censorship.”It’s fair to say that history has been pretty kind to this theory. Consider the support drummed up by mass media for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. To quote the public editor of the New York Times. “To anyone who read the paper between September 2002 and June 2003. the impression that Saddam Hussein possessed. or was acquiring. a frightening arsenal of W.M.D. seemed unmistakable. Except. of course. it appears to have been mistaken.” Consider the September 2002 dossier published by the UK government “to bolster support for war” which turned out to be full of spectacularly incorrect information. and the media’s failure to interrogate those claims.It’s hard to overstate just how cataclysmic these errors were. If the mass media had pushed back against the false claims of weapons of mass destruction. we might have avoided the Iraq war. which killed hundreds of thousands and cost trillions of dollars. Saddam Hussein was not exactly a tough act to follow. but the US still managed to follow its falsely motivated war with a botched occupation which turned Iraq. and arguably the larger Middle East to this day. into a bloodbath.
technology,‘Carpentry Compiler’ turns 3D models to instructions on how to build them,Even to an experienced carpenter. it may not be obvious what the best way is to build a structure they’ve designed. A new digital tool. Carpentry Compiler. provides a way forward. converting the shapes of the structure to a step-by-step guide on how to produce them. It could help your next carpentry project get off the screen and into the shop.“If you think of both design and fabrication as programs. you can use methods from programming languages to solve problems in carpentry. which is really cool.” said project lead Adriana Schulz from the University of Washington’s computer science department. in a news release.It sounds a bit detached from the sawdust and sweat of hands-on woodworking. but they don’t say “measure twice. cut once” for nothing. Carpentry is a cerebral process more than a physical one. and smart. efficient solutions tend to replace ones that are merely well made.What Carpentry Compiler does is codify the rules that govern design and carpentry. for example what materials are available. what tools can do. and so on. and use those to create a solution (in terms of cuts and joins) to a problem (how to turn boards into a treehouse).

technology,Facebook updates crisis response tools. adds WhatsApp integration,Facebook  is expanding Crisis Response. its disaster-reporting and communications feature that’s been used in 300 crises in more than 80 countries. The company today is announcing several new features. including WhatsApp integration. support for first-hand information sharing and an expansion of its “Data for Good” tools for things like better disaster and displacement maps.Crisis Response originally grew out of a handful of features that help family. friends and communities support one another in the wake of a disaster. A couple of years ago. Facebook organized these tools — like Safety Check. Community Help and Fundraisers — all under a centralized “Crisis Response” centralized hub.Today. Facebook is adding new functionality to Crisis Response which will allow people in affected areas to share first-hand information about what they’re witnessing or think others should know — like building collapses or road closures. for example. This is in addition to their existing ability to share requests or offers for help. as before.In addition. Facebook Crisis Response now works with WhatsApp . This particular integration is fairly light — the entire feature set isn’t coming to WhatsApp. to be clear. But people can now offer or request help through the messaging app. instead of using just Facebook Messenger.
technology,DHS wants to expand airport face recognition scans to include US citizens,Homeland Security wants to expand facial recognition checks for travelers arriving to and departing from the U.S. to also include citizens. which had previously been exempt from the mandatory checks.In a filing. the department has proposed that all travelers. and not just foreign nationals or visitors. will have to complete a facial recognition check before they are allowed to enter the U.S.. but also to leave the country.Facial recognition for departing flights has increased in recent years as part of Homeland Security’s efforts to catch visitors and travelers who overstay their visas. The department. whose responsibility is to protect the border and control immigration. has a deadline of 2021 to roll out facial recognition scanners to the largest 20 airports in the United States. despite facing a rash of technical challenges.But although there may not always be a clear way to opt-out of facial recognition at the airport. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents — also known as green card holders — have been exempt from these checks. the existing rules say.Now. the proposed rule change to include citizens has drawn ire from one of the largest civil liberties groups in the country.
technology,Canalys: Chinese cloud infrastructure spending reaches almost $3B a quarter,Canalys  released its latest cloud infrastructure spending numbers for China today. and it’s all trending upward. For starters. the market reached $2.9 billion for the quarter. an increase of 60.8%. China now accounts for 10.4% of worldwide cloud spending. meaning it’s second only to the U.S. in overall spending.That is pretty amazing. given that China was late in coming to the cloud. but also not surprising given the sheer size of the overall potential market. Once it got going. it was bound to gain momentum simply because of that size. Still. it is surprising that it is three times the size in terms of market share of the next closest country. according to Canalys.Most of the business is going to Chinese cloud companies. Alibaba. which. like Amazon. has a retail arm and a cloud arm. leads the way by far. with 45% of the market share (worth $1.3 billion). Tencent is second. with 18.6%. followed by AWS with 8.6% and Baidu with 8.2%. AWS was the only non-Chinese company to register any market share.Wong Yih Khai. senior analyst at Canalys. says the market demand for cloud infrastructure services in China continues to grow at a rapid pace led by demand for artificial intelligence services.
technology,CircleCI launches improved AWS support,For about a year now. continuous integration and delivery service CircleCI has offered Orbs. a way to easily reuse commands and integrations with third-party services. Unsurprisingly. some of the most popular Orbs focus on AWS. as that’s where most of the company’s developers are either testing their code or deploying it. Today. right in time for AWS’s annual re:Invent developer conference in Las Vegas. the company announced that it has now added Orb support for the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). which makes setting up automated CI/CD platforms for testing and deploying to AWS Lambda significantly easier.In total. the company says. more than 11.000 organizations started using Orbs since it launched a year ago. Among the AWS-centric Orbs are those for building and updating images for the Amazon Elastic Container Services and the Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). for example. as well as AWS CodeDeploy support. an Orb for installing and configuring the AWS command line interface. an Orb for working with the S3 storage service and more.“We’re just seeing a momentum of more and more companies being ready to adopt [managed services like Lambda. ECS and EKS]. so this became really the ideal time to do most of the work with the product team at AWS that manages their serverless ecosystem and to add in this capability to leverage that serverless application model and really have this out of the box CI/CD flow ready for users who wanted to start adding these into to Lambda.” CircleCI  VP of business development Tom Trahan told me. “I think when Lambda was in its earlier days. a lot of people would use it and they would use it and not necessarily follow the same software patterns and delivery flow that they might have with their traditional software. As they put more and more into Lambda and are really putting a lot more what I would call ‘production quality code’ out there to leverage. They realize they do want to have that same software delivery capability and discipline for Lambda as well.”
technology,Twitter launches a Privacy Center to centralize its data protection efforts,Twitter  today is launching a new resource that aims to serve as the central place for everything related to the company’s efforts around privacy and data protection. The new site. the Twitter Privacy Center. will host information about Twitter’s initiatives. announcements and new privacy products. as well as other communication about security incidents.The company says it wanted to create a centralized resource so it would be easier to find all the information about Twitter’s work in this area. However. the impacts of Europe’s data protection regulation. GDPR. likely also spurred Twitter’s efforts on this front. along with other data laws.For its own purposes. Twitter now needs to have a more organized approach to consumer data privacy. As a result. it makes sense to put Twitter’s work and announcements onto a consumer-facing site that’s easy to navigate and use.The new Twitter Privacy Center splits information between what’s aimed at users and what’s for partners. On the latter front. it has dedicated pages for GDPR. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and Global DPA (Data Processing Addendum). for example.
technology,New Amazon tool simplifies delivery of containerized machine learning models,As part of the flurry of announcements coming this week out of AWS re:Invent. Amazon announced the release of Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes. a way for data scientists and developers to simplify training. tuning and deploying containerized machine learning models.Packaging machine learning models in containers can help put them to work inside organizations faster. but getting there often requires a lot of extra management to make it all work. Amazon  SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes is supposed to make it easier to run and manage those containers. the underlying infrastructure needed to run the models and the workflows associated with all of it.“While Kubernetes gives customers control and portability. running ML workloads on a Kubernetes cluster brings unique challenges. For example. the underlying infrastructure requires additional management such as optimizing for utilization. cost and performance; complying with appropriate security and regulatory requirements; and ensuring high availability and reliability.” AWS’ Aditya Bindal wrote in a blog post introducing the new feature.When you combine that with the workflows associated with delivering a machine learning model inside an organization at scale. it becomes part of a much bigger delivery pipeline. one that is challenging to manage across departments and a variety of resource requirements.

Calif.-based Fulcrum. a job-placement company for technical projects. has raised $1 million in a seed round of funding. led by local technology investment firm Greatscale Ventures with participation from several private co-investors. the company said.The company has what it calls a fully compliant service for hiring freelancers onto technical projects that had previously only been the purview of full-time staffers — or work that would have been outsourced to pricey consulting firms.Fulcrum says that its job-placement platform meets the regulatory requirements in 90 countries and is designed to give businesses the ability to design. manage and execute projects on demand.The company scrapes all marketplaces that freelancers currently use and onboards them through its own service so that they can work effectively with large corporations.
technology,Tim Cook. Satya Nadella. Elon Musk. Sundar Pichai and more sign renewed commitment to Paris Agreement,The U.S. government may be in the process of formally withdrawing from the term of the Paris Agreement. an international accord on targets to fight climate change. but major U.S. employers say they’ll stay the course in a new statement jointly signed by a group of around 80 chief executives and U.S. labor organization leaders. The statement. posted at UnitedForTheParisAgreement.com. represents a group that either directly employs more than 2 million people in the U.S.. or represents a larger group of 12.5 million through labor organizations.The group collectively says they are “still in” on the Agreement. which many of the undersigned also supported vocally back in 2017 when the Trump administration announced its intent to formally remove itself. They also “urge the United States” to reconsider its current course and also agree to remain committed to the agreement. The Agreement will not only help to potentially counter the ongoing impacts of global climate change. the group says in the letter. but also prepare the way for a “just transition” of the U.S. workforce to “new decent. family supporting jobs and economic opportunity.” implying that bowing out of the Agreement will actually impede the U.S. workforce’s ability to compete on a global scale.Apple  CEO Tim Cook shared the renewed commitment on Twitter. noting in part that “humanity has never faced a greater or more urgent threat than climate change.” and other prominent tech executives have also co-signed. including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.  Tesla’s  Elon Musk.  Google’s Sundar Pichai and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen. Chief executives from other powerful U.S. companies across industries are also represented. including Coca-Cola’s James Quincey. Patagonia’s  Rose Marcario. Unilever’s Alan Jope and Walt Disney’s Robert Iger.
technology,Researchers find making a sick reef sound like a healthy one could help its recovery,A new study. published in Nature Communications (via The Washington Post). found promising early results from an experiment wherein sounds that you’d hear from a healthy reef are played back at a reef that’s dying. It may sound a bit like a bait-and-switch. but previous research has shown that one way to help reefs that are under duress is to encourage diverse and abundant fish populations. which can help counteract the downward spiral that ultimately leads to reef death.Over the course of six weeks. researchers from the U.K. and Australia played audio recordings over speakers installed underwater at dead patches found in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The recordings were taken from healthy sections. and included a range of sounds typical to thriving coral communities. including noises made by fish. shrimp. molluscs and other reef-dwellers. These sounds act as cues for young fish looking to settle down and establish communities of their own.The researchers found that up to twice as many fish ended up populating the reefs where these sounds were played. versus areas in similar states of decay where they were not. They also found that there was more biodiversity at these locations. with up to 50% more species in the mix versus the control sites. and that the new denizens who did make their way to the reefs with the artificial sounds tended to set up to stay.
technology,T-Mobile opens pre-orders on two 5G phones as low-band network goes live,The 5G question has long been carts and horses. The next-generation wireless network has always been an inevitability. of course. but the rollout has always felt a bit piecemeal. T-Mobile. to its credit. is looking to flip the switch all at once (kind of). launching a “nationwide” deployment of 5G to a coverage area it says will reach 200 million of the U.S.’s 327 million residents.The 600MHz low-band network goes live today. fulfilling the promise of 5G in 2019 with nearly a month to spare. That coincides with the pre-order of two 5G-enabled handsets. from OnePlus and Samsung. The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition. at least. is a T-Mobile exclusive here in the States.It’s a premium as far as OnePlus goes. but still arrives at the (relatively) low price of $900. Compare that to the $1.300 Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. Both are officially going on sale on Friday. and should be able to connect to the new network at launch.T-Mobile’s clearly being more deliberate in its roll out here. fighting the urge to plant its flag. Instead. the carrier’s network will be available in wider swaths of land versus the competition’s neighborhood to neighborhood approach. And while the network isn’t expected to be as fast as other solutions. it should reach indoors better — a pretty key differentiator.
technology,Amazon debuts automatic speech recognition service. Amazon Transcribe Medical,Amazon  is expanding its automatic transcription service for AWS. Amazon Transcribe. to include support for medical speech. the company announced this morning at its AWS re:Invent conference. The new machine learning-powered service. Amazon Transcribe Medical. will allow physicians to quickly dictate their clinical notes and speech into accurate text in real time. without any human intervention. Amazon claims.Unlike some services. the physicians won’t have to say things like “comma” or “full stop.” but can speak normally during the dictation process. The text can then be fed to downstream systems. including ER systems or AWS language services. like Amazon Comprehend Medical for entity extraction.The service is also HIPAA-eligible and scales with the users’ needs. meaning you’ll only pay for what you actually use and without upfront fees. notes Amazon.From a technical perspective. the service works as follows.You first capture audio through a device’s microphone. then send PCM audio to a streaming API. based on the WebSocket protocol. The API responds with a series of JSON blobs with the transcribed text. plus word-level time stamps and punctuation. This can also be optionally saved to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.
technology,AWS announces DeepComposer. a machine-learning keyboard for developers,Today. as AWS re:Invent begins. Amazon announced DeepComposer. a machine learning-driven keyboard aimed at developers.“AWS DeepComposer is a 32-key. 2-octave keyboard designed for developers to get hands on with Generative AI. with either pretrained models or your own.” AWS’ Julien Simon wrote in a blog post introducing the company’s latest machine learning hardware.The keyboard is supposed to help developers learn about machine learning in a fun way. and maybe create some music along the way. The area involved in generating creative works in artificial intelligence is called “generative AI.” In other words. it helps you teach machines to generate something creative using “generative adversarial networks.”“Developers. regardless of their background in ML or music. can get started with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This Generative AI technique pits two different neural networks against each other to produce new and original digital works based on sample inputs. With AWS DeepComposer. you can train and optimize GAN models to create original music.” according to Amazon.
technology,Reinventing the relationship between workers and tech,A young father and kitchen worker in Pittsburgh was thrilled to get a job with a big restaurant chain that paid $15 an hour — much more than he had been making in fast food.Soon after starting. however. he learned that his schedule was set through an algorithm that crunches a range of data — from weather forecasts to past sales — to predict customer traffic. optimize shifts. and. ultimately. maximize profits. As a result. his hours were extremely unpredictable and sometimes his shifts were cancelled minutes before they were set to start. A job he believed would provide security now barely gave him enough hours to make rent and provide for his family. And it was all because of how his employer used technology.The Pittsburgh worker’s story is not unique; the average American worker hasn’t gotten a meaningful raise in over 40 years. which has been made worse by meager benefits packages. volatile schedules and pay. and barriers to worker voice. While technology didn’t cause these longstanding challenges. the industry has failed to disrupt them — and at times even scaled and amplified them — as new technologies proliferate the workplace. This is one of the reasons there is a growing backlash against the tech industry. from the Uber and Lyft protests that grounded New York traffic to a halt to Google walkouts to the customer uproar that spurred DoorDash to change its tipping practices. And legal action abounds. Just last week. New Jersey fined Uber $649 million. while Washington D.C. sued DoorDash .But the future doesn’t have to be this way. New and emerging technologies have the power to improve the lives of workers and make jobs more stable. fair. and dignified. while still delivering value and profit. The first step is making sure workers have a seat at the table — and a voice — to shape every aspect of technology. from design and development. investment and adoption. and policymaking and governance. Several new initiatives led by business. government. and workers are embracing this approach and. in the process. offer models for how to create a new. win-win relationship between tech and workers.
technology,Ikea is helping to redesign simulated Mars habitats,Ikea believes its approach to making small spaces more liveable applies even on other planets: The company has been working with an Earth-based research facility that is meant to mimic what a Mars habitat would be like. according to Fast Company. Originally. Ikea sent a designer to the station to seek inspiration for creating functional furniture for small apartments — but it quickly became a two-way street. which could mean the Swedish home furnishing company has a say in how future human colonists live on other planets.As detailed by FastCo. Ikea designer Christina Levenborn spent time living in the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. which is situated in a desert and designed to feel as close as possible to the experience of living and working on the actual Red Planet. At any given time. there are usually a number of these types of simulated research projects going on. taking crews of volunteers and putting them into a simulated work/life scenario to help us prepare for when astronauts do the real thing. NASA is hoping to begin establishing a more permanent human presence on the Moon by 2024. which means this work could have real-world applications in space sooner rather than later.Levenborn did indeed design an Ikea collection inspired by her time in the habitat. but she and others at Ikea returned the favor as well. coming up with organizational strategies and interior design layouts that emphasized a sense of privacy and personal space even in very cramped quarters. using Ikea shelving units and modular. wheeled furniture for flexibility and tidiness. Warm lighting and outdoor equipment for indoor use also contributed to making the habitat more… well. habitable.

technology,Millions of SMS messages exposed in database security lapse,A massive database storing tens of millions of SMS  text messages. most of which were sent by businesses to potential customers. has been found online.The database is run by TrueDialog. a business SMS provider for businesses and higher education providers. which lets companies. colleges. and universities send bulk text messages to their customers and students. The Austin. Texas-based company says one of the advantages to its service is that recipients can also text back. allowing them to have two-way conversations with brands or businesses.The database stored years of sent and received text messages from its customers and processed by TrueDialog. But because the database was left unprotected on the internet without a password. none of the data was encrypted and anyone could look inside.Security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar found the exposed database earlier this month as part of their internet scanning efforts.TechCrunch examined a portion of the data. which contained detailed logs of messages sent by customers who used TrueDialog’s system. including phone numbers and SMS message contents. The database contained information about university finance applications. marketing messages from businesses with discount codes. and job alerts. among other things.

It’s the first time the government has tried to enforce a new law against ‘fake news’ outside its borders.The post by fringe news site States Times Review (STR). contained “scurrilous accusations” according to the Singapore government.The States Times Review post contained accusations about the arrest of an alleged whistleblower and election-rigging.Singapore authorities had previously ordered STR editor Alex Tan to correct the post but the Australian citizen said he would “not comply with any order from a foreign government”.Mr Tan. who was born in Singapore. said he was an Australian citizen living in Australia and was not subject to the law. In a follow-up post. he said he would “defy and resist every unjust law”. He also posted the article on Twitter. LinkedIn and Google Docs and challenged the government to order corrections there as well.On the note Facebook said it “is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information”. They then embedded the note at the bottom of the original post. which was not altered. Only social media users in Singapore could see the note.
technology,Microsoft is Creating a New Rust-Based Programming Language For Secure Coding ,Under Project Verona. Microsoft is working to make Windows 10 more secure by integrating Mozilla-developed Rust for low-level Windows components. "'Memory safety' is the term for coding frameworks that help protect memory space from being abused by malware." reports ZDNet. "Project Verona at Microsoft is meant to progress the company's work here to close off this attack vector." From the report:Microsoft's Project Verona could turn out to be just an experiment that leads nowhere. but the company has progressed far enough to have detailed some of its ideas through the UK-based non-profit Knowledge Transfer Network. Matthew Parkinson. a Microsoft researcher from the Cambridge Computer Lab in the UK who's dedicated to "investigating memory management for managed programming languages." gave a talk last week focusing on what the company is doing to address these memory issues.In the talk. Parkinson discussed the work Microsoft has done with MemGC. which is short for Memory Garbage Collector. for Internet Explorer (IE) and Edge. MemGC addressed vulnerabilities in the standard browser feature known as a Document Object Model (DOM). a representation of the data used by browsers to interpret web pages. Google's elite Project Zero hackers were impressed with Microsoft's MemGC after canvassing major browsers. [...] The other class of bugs Microsoft is working on to address relates to uninitialized memory in a way that also doesn't kill performance. [...] Parkinson said Microsoft is rewriting some "targeted" components in Rust. His talk focused on language design and compartmentalization. "If we want compartments. and to carve up the legacy bits of our code so [attackers'] exploit code can't get out. what do we need in the language design that can help with that?" This is Project Verona and Parkinson said it was the first time he'd discussed the project. which will be made open source "soon". It is a new language for what Microsoft is calling "safe infrastructure programming.""The challenge for Microsoft is dealing with the 'application spectrum.' which spans from C# for desktop apps through to C and C# for Exchange. ASP.NET. Azure. and device drivers. to deep Windows components like memory management and boot loaders and the Windows kernel hardware abstraction layer (HAL)." the report says.
technology,Vulnerability In Fully Patched Android Phones Under Active Attack By Bank Thieves,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica:A vulnerability in millions of fully patched Android phones is being actively exploited by malware that's designed to drain the bank accounts of infected users. researchers said on Monday. The vulnerability allows malicious apps to masquerade as legitimate apps that targets have already installed and come to trust. researchers from security firm Promon reported in a post. Running under the guise of trusted apps already installed. the malicious apps can then request permissions to carry out sensitive tasks. such as recording audio or video. taking photos. reading text messages or phishing login credentials. Targets who click yes to the request are then compromised.Researchers with Lookout. a mobile security provider and a Promon partner. reported last week that they found 36 apps exploiting the spoofing vulnerability. The malicious apps included variants of the BankBot banking trojan. BankBot has been active since 2017. and apps from the malware family have been caught repeatedly infiltrating the Google Play Market. The vulnerability is most serious in versions 6 through 10. which account for about 80% of Android phones worldwide. Attacks against those versions allow malicious apps to ask for permissions while posing as legitimate apps. There's no limit to the permissions these malicious apps can seek. Access to text messages. photos. the microphone. camera. and GPS are some of the permissions that are possible. A user's only defense is to click "no" to the requests."The vulnerability is found in a function known as TaskAffinity. a multitasking feature that allows apps to assume the identity of other apps or tasks running in the multitasking environment." reports Ars Technica. While Google has removed the [unnamed] malicious apps from its Play Store. according to Promon. the vulnerability is still unfixed in all versions of Android.
technology,Coal Power Becoming 'Uninsurable' As Firms Refuse Cover,AmiMoJo quotes a report from The Guardian:The number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects more than doubled this year and for the first time U.S. companies have taken action. leaving Lloyd's of London and Asian insurers as the "last resort" for fossil fuels. according to a new report. The report. which rates the world's 35 biggest insurers on their actions on fossil fuels. declares that coal -- the biggest single contributor to climate change -- "is on the way to becoming uninsurable" as most coal projects cannot be financed. built or operated without insurance.Ten firms moved to restrict the insurance cover they offer to companies that build or operate coal power plants in 2019. taking the global total to 17. said the Unfriend Coal campaign. which includes 13 environmental groups such as Greenpeace. Client Earth and Urgewald. a German NGO. The report will be launched at an insurance and climate risk conference in London on Monday. as the UN climate summit gets underway in Madrid. The first insurers to exit coal policies were all European. but since March. two U.S. insurers -- Chubb and Axis Capital -- and the Australian firms QBE and Suncorp have pledged to stop or restrict insurance for coal projects. At least 35 insurers with combined assets of $8.9 trillion. equivalent to 37% of the insurance industry's global assets. have begun pulling out of coal investments. A year ago. 19 insurers holding more than $6 trillion in assets were divesting from fossil fuels.

The Mercury News reports:European officials have launched a "preliminary" investigation into Facebook and Google in order to determine how people's information is used for ad purposes. The Mercury News reports:The European Commission. which oversees antitrust issues for the European Unions. said it has opened a preliminary investigation into Facebook and Google in order to determine if the two companies are adhering to new regulations meant to give individuals more power over how their personal information is used by social networks and other tech companies. That law. called General Data Protection Law (GDPR). went into effect across the European Union in 2018. "The Commission has sent out questionnaires as part of our preliminary investigations into Google's and Facebook's data practices." said an EC spokesperson in a statement given to this news organization.

technology,All New Cellphone Users In China Must Now Have Their Face Scanned ,An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review:Customers in China who buy SIM cards or register new mobile-phone services must have their faces scanned under a new law that came into effect yesterday. China's government says the new rule. which was passed into law back in September. will "protect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace." It can be seen as part of an ongoing push by China's government to make sure that people use services on the internet under their real names. thus helping to reduce fraud and boost cybersecurity. On the other hand. it also looks like part of a drive to make sure every member of the population can be surveilled.The Financial Times reported yesterday that tech companies in China are helping to create influential United Nations standards for the facial recognition technology. which will help shape rules on how facial recognition is used around the world.
technology,Cord-Cutting Pushed to ‘Tipping Point’ as Video Streaming Grows,The media ecosystem is undergoing a massive change as streaming video looks to extend its recent dominance over traditional distribution. according to research firm MoffettNathanson. which wrote that a large minority of cable consumers could cut their subscriptions in coming years.“The video market is in full disruption and this year could be the cord cutting tipping point.” analyst Michael Nathanson wrote to clients. “Media companies will need to master a whole new suite of skill sets to win going forward.” with content creation. user interfaces and “churn mitigation strategies” among the factors that could determine the next generation of winners in the market.Consumers have been abandoning traditional media bundles for years. instead looking to services like Netflix Inc. or Walt Disney Co.’s recently launched Disney+ service. which has signed up more than 10 million subscribers since launching in November. Streaming services have made in-roads into a number of major categories of video entertainment. including TV shows and movies.In a measure of how big streaming has become. Wells Fargo Securities wrote that between November 17-23. “The Mandalorian.” a series from Disney+ set in the “Star Wars” universe. was the “most in-demand show in OTT and overall on a linear+OTT basis.” OTT stands for “over the top” content. which bypasses cable boxes. Linear TV airs at set times. as opposed to being on-demand. as with streaming. The firm cited data from Parrot Analytics in its report. which was dated Nov. 29.
technology,'Grinch bots' are here to ruin your holiday shopping,Consumers may think they’re avoiding the crush this holiday season by shopping online. unaware that as they’re trying to get through the digital doors. so too are hordes of bots. And they’re throwing elbows.Up to 97 percent of all online traffic to retailer login pages this holiday shopping week comes from bots. largely operated by organized gangs of cybercriminals. according to estimates by cybersecurity firm Radware.The bots fill out online forms and navigate retail sites faster than a real person can. and try to swiftly purchase limited supply gifts before you’ve even filled up your cart. The items are then sold for a higher price on third-party sites. The cyber thieves also crack into accounts. drain accounts of rewards and other digital currency. conduct credit card fraud. and more. said Ron Winward. a Radware spokesman.“Website operators are seeing uptick in bot activity leading up to Cyber Monday from people trying out their bots.” said Winward. “People are really competing with automated infrastructure and bots to get hot holiday items.”
technology,Portland plans to propose the strictest facial recognition ban in the country,As the federal government plods along on developing privacy laws. some cities are taking matters into their own hands—with facial recognition technology at the top of the list. Now. Portland. Oregon. has plans to ban the use of facial recognition for both the government and private businesses in the city. a move that could make Portland’s ban the most restrictive in the United States.The proposed ban comes after cities including San Francisco. Oakland. and Berkeley in California. and Somerville in Massachusetts. have already banned the use of facial recognition by their city government agencies. including police departments. But Portland’s ban goes a step further by expanding to private businesses—if it makes it into law and takes effect in spring 2020. as planned.It could be a preview of what to expect across the country. “I think we’re going to start to see more and more [private sector bans].” says ACLU of Northern California attorney Matt Cagle. who helped draft the San Francisco legislation that later served as the model for Oakland and Berkeley. “People are really concerned about facial recognition use and the tracking of their innate features by governments and private corporations.”Along with being used in policing. facial recognition is becoming a fixture in retail stores. stadiums. and even schools. Software providers like Microsoft. Amazon. and IBM offer algorithms that any developer can use to analyze faces. and other big companies like Facebook have already implemented facial recognition on social media.
technology,Archivists Are Trying to Make Sure a ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ Never Goes Down,It’s hard to find free and open access to scientific material online. The latest studies and current research huddle behind paywalls unread by those who could benefit. But over the last few years. two sites—Library Genesis and Sci-Hub—have become high-profile. widely used resources for pirating scientific papers.The problem is that these sites have had a lot of difficulty actually staying online. They have faced both legal challenges and logistical hosting problems that has knocked them offline for long periods of time. But a new project by data hoarders and freedom of information activists hopes to bring some stability to one of the two “Pirate Bays of Science.”Library Genesis (LibGen) contains 33 terabytes of books. scientific papers. comics. and more in its scientific library. That’s a lot of data to host when countries and science publishers are constantly trying to get you shut down.Last week. redditors launched a project to better seed. or host. LibGen's files.“It's the largest free library in the world. servicing tens of thousands of scientists and medical professionals around the world who live in developing countries that can't afford to buy books and scientific journals. There's almost nothing else like this on Earth. They're using torrents to fulfill World Health Organization and U.N. charters. And it's not just one site index—it's a network of mirrored sites. where a new one pops up every time another gets taken down.” user shrine said on Reddit. Shrine is helping to start the project.
technology,Amazon lets doctors record your conversations and put them in your medical files,Amazon’s next big step in health care is with voice transcription technology that’s designed to allow doctors to spend more time with patients and less time at the computer.At Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference on Tuesday. the company is launching a service called Amazon Transcribe Medical. which transcribes doctor-patient interactions and plugs the text straight into the medical record.“Our overarching goal is to free up the doctor. so they have more attention going to where it should be directed.” said Matt Wood. vice president of artificial intelligence at AWS. “And that’s to the patient.”At last year’s re:Invent. AWS introduced a related service called Amazon Comprehend Medical. which “allows developers to process unstructured medical text and identify information such as patient diagnosis. treatments. dosages. symptoms and signs. and more.” according to a blog post.Wood said the two services are linked and can be used together.
