FOOD,Dallas Throws a Texas-size Wine and Food Party,"After decades of dismissing the idea of taking a guided city tour, I have now come around to believe that, with the proper guide, I can learn a whole lot more  in a shorter period of time than if I did my own expeditions, guidebook in hand, around a vast city like Dallas. I had not just a proper guide but a fellow whose exuberance and intimate knowledge of the city opened my eyes not only to what was historical about Dallas but what is new and exciting, all against a background of how this wheeling, dealing Texas town grew into what it is today.  His name was John Estes and he worked for the Discover Dallas Tours, and over a period of three hours I learned more than I ever had, despite my having visited the city a score of times since the 1970s. His detailed knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, delivered at the spot where it happened, gave me insights I'd never known or even considered before, and his anecdotes about everything from the great red neon horse that stands in the Old Red Museum (it became the mascot symbol of Mobil oil) to the development of newly gentrifying neighborhoods and the quirky grandeur of the ultra-opulent Highland Park showed me just how diverse the city has become. The information about the 70 bronze statues of a cattle herd in Pioneer Park by Texas artist Robert Summers and the myriad museums by some of the biggest international names in architecture was fascinating, right down to how the unexpectedly harsh sunlight reflected from a new condo is compromising the exteriors of sculptures in the Renzo Piano-designed Nasher Museum. The newest is the Perot Museum of Science and Nature, designed as a big floating chunk of recycled materials by architect Thom Mayne. I was in Dallas, for the second time, to attend one of this country's premier wine, food and art events, Savor Dallas, founded a decade ago by Jim White and Vicki Briley-White, who have moved the increasingly popular event from the Irving Convention Center in Las Colinas to the new Dallas Convention Center, which is attached with an umbilical walkway to the huge, new Omni Dallas Hotel. An enchanting part of the weekend's events is the Arts District Wine Stroll, featuring wines from 23 different wineries, with food stops along the way at Nasher Sculpture Center (below) and Meyerson Symphony Center, including many colorful food trucks. The kick-off is at the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens (below), an extraordinary 66 acres of impeccably tended landscape and flower sculptures. Here, local chefs served up hors d' oeuvres and vintners poured wines, the strolling attendees serenaded by a fine jazz band. It's a good way to get familiar with the vibrant Texas wine industry, including labels Fall Creek Vineyards, Becker Vineyards, Messina Hof and Kiepersol Estate. Wine and serious eno-talk took place the next day at the Winemaker's Tasting Panel in the hotel's steak house, where participants listened to panelists from various global wine regions, including Chile, Germany, Texas and California, followed that evening by a truly impressive wine tasting of reserve wines, including several I've never seen poured with such generosity, like Château Cos d' Éstournel 2008 and Ruffino Greppone Mazzi Brunello di Montalcino 2007. That Saturday evening highlight of the oversubscribed weekend was the International Grand Tasting (below; photo by LASphoto) that featured scores of chefs' tables and wines rarely if ever brought together in one huge convention hall. But then, Texas never does anything small. "
FOOD,"We Tasted The New Fruit Punch Oreos, So You Don't Have To","We're not sure why, but the good people at Nabisco decided to make Fruit Punch Oreos. Just like last summer's Watermelon flavored Oreos debacle, they're only available at Walmart, where you can buy them to your heart's content (or not) starting April 28. They're available for a limited time -- while supplies last -- and, well, we think they might last a while. Today we were both terrified and excited when a bag arrived at our office. They carried with them the aroma of Kool-Aid and red Starburst, and thusly we let the package sit on our desk, heckling our cowardly hearts while we put off the thought of actually tasting them. Not sure whether the general public would even be interested in the existence of Fruit Punch Oreos, we posted a photo of the package to our Instagram and Twitter accounts to gauge your reaction. And then you did this: Not wanting to leave you hanging, we gathered some brave souls from around the newsroom at The Huffington Post to give their candid thoughts on the new cookie. Behold, these editorial warriors who fought through the pain just for you: We just keep wondering why Oreos don't come out with a Nutella-flavored filling. That might just make us forget about this whole thing."
FOOD,"Yes, The Chia Seeds You Eat Are The Same Ones That Grow On Chia Pets","We've been hearing a lot about chia seeds usurping flax as the new health food seed, and it's clear to see that they have been gaining in popularity. Chia seeds are making their way into baked goods, smoothies and are even getting added to a simple glass of water. They've gone mainstream -- and can now be found in a lot of the healthier products at the grocery store. We are totally into it, especially when they make their way into decadent puddings. But as we were shoveling blueberry chia pudding into our face, we got to thinking: is this the same chia seed of the ch-ch-ch-chia pets? We suspected it was and we were right. They are one and the same, people -- and a glowing example of marketing genius. While they are a healthy food that dates all the way back to the Aztecs and Mayans, and they do also sprout very easily, there's something unsettling about lumping the hot new health trend in the same category as the Chia Pet."
FOOD,"Why Tuna's Both Cheap and Expensive, Plentiful and Very Endangered","Tuna is a fish of contradictions: it's hard not to love, but it's also hard to love anyone who's just eaten it. If you're buying light tuna, it's probably skipjack, which is not scientifically considered tuna, though nobody told that to the FDA before they commercially labeled it as such. In addition to the tuna family's adopted son, you'll also find canned albacore and yellowfin. They grow extremely quickly and reproduce in massive numbers at a young age, despite constant lecturing from their more mature bluefin cousins. Fishermen considered tuna a trash fish until the early 1900s, so, back then, the ocean was full of trash in a very different way than it is now. Americans looked down on it because of our preference for white over dark meat. Thus, the earliest canned tuna was the white meat of the albacore. Much of the flavor (and smell) of tuna comes from its oil, so in order to smother the stank, the earliest canners learned to remove the oil and pack it with water after steaming it. This worked to both remove bacteria and increase shelf life. Nowadays, the most expensive canned tuna is packed with extra-virgin olive oil to emulate the fish's natural oils. Science can't explain it, but yellowfins love to hang out underneath dolphins. Commercial fishermen send out spotter planes looking for dolphins, then drop nets underneath them and pull out massive schools of tuna. It's not without collateral dolphin damage. In 1990, the U.S. passed an act to protect dolphins from net-fishing, but many think the act wasn't comprehensive enough, and that tuna catching practices are still pretty fishy. Bluefin are the largest, oiliest, and most delicious of all tuna. They're also incredibly strong swimmers who migrate thousands of miles. So strong, in fact, that fishermen's nets were not solid enough to catch them until the adoption of nylon in the '50s. Back then, boats would pull up their nets for fear of bluefin destroying them. Now, a catch means the fisherman has netted thousands of dollars."
FOOD,The Whiskey Sour,"When he's not busy running the cocktail program at New York City's Maialino, Erik Lombardo is giving Food52 the rundown on all things spirits -- and showing us the best ways to drink them. Today: A classic whiskey sour to set all other whiskey sours straight. Before the revolution (that’s what I’m calling the surge of higher-quality drinks in the last decade -- for what was it if not an uprising against our apple-tini guzzling oppressors?), the phrase whiskey sour conjured an image that would make you shudder: an insipid blend of bottom-shelf whiskey, watery ice, and bottled sour mix that vied with the day-glo cherry for most artificial ingredients in a single item. These cocktails would invariably be served in brightly lit basement bars with drop ceilings and vinyl furniture, prepared by those old enough to know better and ordered by those too old to care. But the true sour is a study in simplicity -- of whiskey, sugar, and citrus. Lemon is most common for the latter, but juice with any kind of noticeable acidity will work well. Traditional sours nearly always called for egg white, too, an ingredient that adds a light, frothy, textural element to the cocktail. And believe it or not, the egg white provided a much-needed boost of protein after a night out on the town, something that was very popular with the early morning drinkers in the sporting set who made the cocktail so popular in the 19th century. When properly integrated into a cocktail, egg whites make it light and frothy, much like cream without the heaviness. To do it right, start by dry shaking -- a method in which all of the ingredients except ice are shaken first. The dry shake will add millions of tiny bubbles to the cocktail that will be encapsulated in the semi-stable egg white, making a kind of quick meringue. After the dry shake, add your ice, shake as normal (which is to say, with feeling), strain, and enjoy. The beauty of this cocktail is that it can be made with any spirit -- just sub it out for the whiskey. If you want to switch things up even more, try the Rattlesnake (a traditional rye sour with the glass rinsed with absinthe), or the New York Sour. However you enjoy your sours, it’s a good idea to heed the advice of the great Harry Craddock: The way to drink a cocktail is quickly, while it’s still laughing at you."
FOOD,The Best Regional Food Destinations in the U.S.,"With spring finally here and summer fast approaching, road trip season is upon us. Right alongside blasting music with the windows down and singing loudly with a car full of friends, the stops to eat along the way can be the highlight of any truly good road trip. When is there a better excuse to soberly eat massive amounts of unhealthy foods? Although driving across the country can be a daunting task, at least there is a host of different and equally delicious regional eats to make a road trip truly memorable and tasty. This one goes without saying, but as a Californian, I stand by the pure genius that is an Animal Style burger. Cheese, special sauce, caramelized onions and pickles top the quarter-ounce patty and create the ideally messy eating experience that ends all too quickly. The other not-so-secret menu items -- Animal-style fries (DIY recipe here), grilled cheese, protein-style burger, a Neapolitan milkshake and fries well-done -- are also crowd pleasers that have taken fast food to a higher level. (Check out the Spoon Instagram for a drool-worthy burger pic.) For the times you're not feeling a burger in California, however, go for Mexican. Once you've tried Californian Mexican food, there's no going back to any other states' renditions. If you find yourself in the San Francisco Bay Area, stop by one of the six Gordo Taqueria hole-in-the-wall locations in San Francisco, Berkeley or Albany for one of the best quesadillas or burritos (hint: Get the carnitas) of your life. Opt to stuff the quesadilla with carnitas, sour cream and guacamole and watch as they griddle the envelope of cheese to excellently greasy perfection. Chicago food is synonymous with one word. Okay, maybe two. Deep-dish. If you want the best, it's commonly acknowledged that Lou Malnati's is the place to go. Three words: flaky, butter crust. Do it and spend the extra 75 cents for 75 times the magic that the special crust brings. Lou Malnati's is known for using a special sausage blend and tomato sauce recipe since its opening in 1943. And for 71 years, Chicago natives have turned up their noses at the other options that seem to pale in comparison. If you have spent any extended time in North Carolina and have yet to try Cook-Out, I deem your experience a failure. Perhaps the best deal on the planet (and one that's open until 3:30 a.m., at that), Cook-Out is a college student's dream. Known for its burgers cooked outdoors style, Cook-Out also offers an array of classic cookout options, like hot dogs, chopped pork barbecue, chicken strips and grilled chicken sandwiches. But two things make Cook-Out a standout: the milkshakes and the trays. The menu boasts over 40 flavors of fancy milkshakes, of which you can combine any number to create your perfect creamy confection. I am a loyal Mocha-Oreo fan myself, but whatever your milkshake tastes and dreams are, Cook-Out is sure to deliver. Finally, the Cook-Out tray is the best deal I've yet to find. For only $3.99 you can choose a main, two sides and a large drink. Your sides can even include chicken nuggets and a corn dog. Sides? Those are mains in themselves. And for only 99 cents extra, you can upgrade your drink to a milkshake. My own cheeseburger, Cajun fries, hushpuppies, and a mocha Oreo milkshake tray might be the most valuable $4.98 I've ever spent."
FOOD,4/20 Easter Treats Give 'Sugar High' A Whole New Meaning,"This year, Easter lands on 4/20 -- the international day for celebrating all things marijuana! Naturally, the combined holiday has inspired a re-imagining of some classic Easter treats by infusing them with medical marijuana, giving sugar high a whole new meaning. If you don't know what 420 is all about, read Ryan Grim's detailed history of the term. If you do, and you'll be celebrating marijuana's big day out along with your regular holiday plans, consider picking up one of the marijuana-infused treats below. But remember, these sweets from San Diego, Calif.-based Chronic Desserts are for adult celebrators only -- there are 240mg of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana associated with the high sensation, in the cookies and chocolate egg. Their cakes range from 480mg up to 1200mg."
FOOD,How to Make Kale Smoothies You Actually Want to Drink,"Everyone's still so excited about kale. Still! In its trendiness, kale is like the bacon of the vegetable world, only, you know, rather than being super tasty and delightful and kind of horrible for you, it's extremely healthy and it takes some real tricks to make it delicious. But the kale buzz is nearing Cronut-like levels, which have just seemed to increase over the past few years. The truth is, this previously unappreciated vegetable is getting tons of attention for good reason: it's extremely nutritious. Stuffed with 45 different flavonoids, packed with antioxidants, and full of fiber, incorporating kale can be one of the best ways to improve your diet. One easy way to pop some kale into your diet is green smoothies. But if you've ever tried incorporating kale into your breakfast smoothies before, you know that it doesn't always work out exactly as desired. With its bitter, peppery flavor, it takes a little coaxing to get it to balance right in a beverage."
FOOD,This Coffee Machine Forces You To Make Friends Before It'll Dispense Your Drink,"When you haven't had your morning coffee yet, the last thing you probably feel like doing is making small talk with a stranger. If you're anything like us, you need coffee before you can form anything close to an intelligible sentence. You'll not only be moving at a tenth of your usual pace, but you'll also be cranky and irritable until you get your morning fix. Striking up a conversation with a stranger before caffeine has entered your body is essentially inconceivable to you. If this sounds at all like you (and we won't judge you if this coffee addiction doesn't apply, we promise), you should stay far away from this new coffee machine. The Economic Development Board of Singapore (EDB) has developed a coffee machine that won't serve you coffee until you introduce yourself to someone. It's called the Coffee Connector and it sounds like our worst nightmare. In order for the Coffee Connector to work, two people must be standing in front of it, and they must introduce themselves to one another. Only then will the coffee machine brew your cup of joe (a.k.a your life source). The Coffee Connector serves the Supremo Blend from Highlander Coffee, a Singapore-based coffee roaster. The way EDB sees it, coffee and networking go hand in hand. 'Let's grab coffee' often means more than just coffee. It signifies the start to relationships, opportunities and business decisions, EDB's website states. The machine debuted at the The Economist Big Rethink Conference on March 13 in New York City, and according to EDB, it forged more than 200 successful connections."
FOOD,There's a Dude Like This in Every Coffee Shop in America,"Coffee shops are like assholes: everyone's got one, and they're full of assholes. Wait... that's not right. But you know what is? This breakdown of the clothing, accessories, and habits of that one guy who's always driving baristas & other customers nuts at your local cafe. This hoser dresses himself carefully just to hog an outlet all damn day at local java joints across the country. Get familiar with the clothing & accessories that give him away, or be damned to endure him for eternity/the remainder of your coffee. Espresso drinks you've never heard of: Sure, a cortado is basically just a half-sized macchiato. But if he ordered it like that, everyone wouldn't know that he lived in Spain after undergrad while he was finding himself. So, yeah. Thick-framed glasses: Are those even prescription? Wait... do they even have lenses?! Desert boots: Despite never lacing them, these are the nicest shoes he owns. Everything is either beat-up sneakers or those rubber sandals that foreign dudes wear with capris. (He found those in Spain, too.) Hand-rolled cigarettes: You're beginning to suspect his entire persona is imported from Europe. Earbuds: When he's not conference-call whisper-screaming into that inline mic, these babies are blasting Ho Hey! by The Lumineers so loudly that you momentarily consider clapping along. Then you remember you've heard this song 74,758,362 times, and would rather get the clap than listen to it again. Ho... HEY! Beanie: Regardless of season -- August? Sure! -- he's wearing one. Either it's a watch cap rolled up 3 inches above his ears like a condom, or it's a slouchy number that's barely clinging to the back of his head. You idly wonder if he stores food in the weird pouch that forms at the base of his neck. Chambray shirt: Dress shirts are corporate, and he's no suit -- he's thinking of launching his own thing soon, which basically means he read a Fast Company article about micro-entrepreneurship, and is recently unemployed. Plus, if he ever actually works, it's always here. Somehow, you feel overdressed? Purposely careless facial hair: Sorry, he didn't have time for the whole routine this morning. Even though he got here at 2 p.m., smelling like a rustic whiskey still with subtle notes of tarragon. And his hair is on the way to open casting for Tousled2Perfection, a made-up movie that sounded like a wayyyy better burn in your head."
FOOD,Cooking Off the Cuff: Waiting for Spring With a Triple-Carrot Risotto,"I'm not sure whether the expression tripling down exists, but that's what I seem to have done with one of the more flavorful vegetables still hanging around in the farmers' market pending the arrival of spring produce: carrots. And I brought them into a risotto in three forms, all of them adding flavor and some adding texture. With certain other vegetable risottos -- notably squash -- I've acquired the habit of finely grating some of the title ingredient and cooking it along with the rice. It falls apart in the liquid, creating a lovely creaminess and, of course, reinforcing the flavor. With this carrot version, though, I've gone one step further: even the stock tastes of little more than carrot (with a little trickery to heighten that flavor). I've also used a non-Italian approach to spicing, bringing in cumin seed because of its particular affinity with carrots, and a little fennel seed to round things out. So, no, this risotto doesn't taste traditionally Italian; just delicious. I made the stock in a pressure cooker: A pound of carrots, peeled and sliced; one shallot (or onion), peeled and not sliced; not much salt; a little cumin seed and even less fennel seed; and a piece of dried kombu seaweed. The shallot and the kombu are there to enhance the carrot flavor; having put it in yourself, you will smell and taste the seaweed, but no one else will. They'll just wonder why this stock tastes so good. I drowned the ingredients in water (a bit less than two quarts/liters) and pressure-cooked for 20 minutes, then let the cooker cool of its own accord and strained the stock through a very fine strainer (or through paper toweling or a coffee filter). The second carrot element is the finely grated carrot: a good sized one, weighing about 6 ounces (170 g) for two portions, though quantities are not all that crucial here. I used a Microplane rasp-grater, but a food processor or the finest side of a box grater would work all right. I sweated a minced shallot (again, onion would be fine), 1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seed, 1/4 teaspoon whole fennel seed and some butter in my favorite risotto-making pan; when the shallot had softened, I added the grated carrots and stirred them over medium-low heat until they began to cook, seasoning with salt and pepper. At some point I also prepared the third tranche of carrots: another carrot of similar size, peeled and cut into scant-1/4-inch (6 mm) dice, then caramelized in butter over medium heat with a sprinkle of salt. They should be almost crunchy, but cooked: they will get only brief additional cooking. When they were done, I patted off excess fat with a paper towel. Likewise, I made some little buttery croutons, over low heat so the bread would get crisp right through. But, you know what? I did this only because there were no nuts in the house: my ideal garnish for this risotto would have been toasted walnuts. Getting back to the risotto pan: I shoved the mass of carrots to the side to make room for a little more butter and a generous 2/3 cup (170 g) of rice -- I used the carnaroli variety, as I almost always do. When the rice had cooked with the butter for a minute, I stirred it together with the grated carrots and added 1/2 cup (120 ml) white wine. That's a bit more than I'd normally use, but the carrots and carrot stock are sweet and the acidity in the wine helps balance the dish. From here I followed standard risotto procedure, stirring pretty much constantly, and gradually adding carrot stock kept hot over a small flame. When the risotto was very nearly done, I stirred in the browned dice of carrot, let it warm through and checked for seasoning. A trifle more acidity was needed, so I stirred in about 1/3 cup (80 ml) tart crème fraîche, which also made for a more luxurious consistency. A squeeze of lemon juice would have been another possibility. I then served it up, garnished with crunchy croutons and not garnished with cheese. It was very carroty -- in an entirely good way -- and the cumin flavor was alluring. The rice, however, still made itself known, and that is the point of a risotto, isn't it?"
FOOD,"STUDY: Teens Are Spending All Their Money On Starbucks, Not Clothes","Remember when you were a teenager and you hung out at the mall all the time? The teenage landscape looks very different these days. Teens are over the mall and they're into restaurants. A study by Piper Jaffray released on April 8 reveals that teens are now spending more on food than they are on clothing. It's the first time that food has trumped fashion since the study started. Since spending on food occurs less by e-commerce and more in person, most food expenditures necessarily take place at food establishments -- hence the rise of restaurants and the fall of the mall. In 2014, American teens visited the mall an average of 29 times per year, down from 38 times in 2007. Quietly, the restaurant has displaced the mall as the socially acceptable place to hangout for teenagers in America, Quartz says. Starbucks is the favorite restaurant brand, followed by McDonald's, Chipotle, Olive Garden and Taco Bell. Food brands from Pizza Hut to Budweiser are putting great energy into reaching millennials these days. It looks like they should expand their target audience to include teens. With its new fried chicken corsage, KFC seems to be ahead of the game. Will other restaurants follow?"
FOOD,This Butter Company's Ad Is Pretty Spacey,"Everyone loves some good food porn every now and then. Lurpak, a Danish butter company, has just taken food porn to new heights -- to outer space, to be exact. In an ad for Lurpak's new Cooks Range line -- which looks like a collection of oils, butters and sprays from the video -- the company takes viewers to the final frontier. Your kitchen will never look the same. The video beautifully channels 2001: A Space Odyssey and is fittingly set to Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The scene starts in a dimly lit kitchen, and as the earth turns, the sun illuminates different foods. The stove fires up like a rocket launching into space, egg yolks fly into flour like astroids and meringues break like ground in an earthquake. The company's past ads are similarly enticing and cinematic, but this latest one takes the cake. It might be a little dramatic for butter, but butter does elicit strong emotions -- good and bad. And we wouldn't complain if all cooking videos were this beautiful and otherworldly. As the ad commands, Cooks, venture forth, and watch this stunning video."
FOOD,The Best Pizza in Vietnam,"I used to be one of those snarky people who said things like: I can't imagine why anyone would travel all the way to Asia, only to eat pizza when they can get it at home. In fact, we recently met a person who said exactly that, and I finally got the chance to hear how obnoxious it sounds. Turns out, there are lots of valid reasons to eat pizza in Vietnam. For instance, you could be intimidated by eating completely unfamiliar dishes in a foreign country, or, perhaps, you're just not much of a foodie and want something easy and familiar. Or, you could have a weak stomach or traveler's diarrhea and need something simple. Maybe, you really love pizza and are on a mission to find the best pizza in every country (which sounds awesome, so someone please start a blog about this already). You might have an eating disorder with associated food phobias. Or, you could be a long-term traveler craving a little variety and a taste of home. We arrived in Saigon over four months ago for a year+ adventure through SE Asia, and it was all I could do not to leap out of a moving cab toward the first bánh mì stall we passed. We were in sensory overload tasting everything in-country for the first time, and it was all mind-blowingly delicious. Over time, we've discovered our favorite, go-to dishes and can now distinguish stellar versions from not-so-great ones. In the process, we've developed taste bud fatigue. Vietnam boasts an incredible number of dishes, and while they can vary from region to region and even food stall to food stall, the flavor profile is essentially the same. We started to crave both variety and a taste of home... a good pizza, for instance. We've tried pizza all over Vietnam, from small towns to the capital of Hanoi, from big chains to mom and pop shops (as most businesses are in Vietnam), from tourist hotspots to the middle of nowhere. Folks, it is a bad scene. The tomato sauce is usually intensely sweet, the cheese non-existent, and the crust. Oh... the crust. One place actually called its crust a tortilla-like, flatbread base. I. JUST. CAN'T. Unequivocally, the best pizza can be found at Pizza Chi in Cao Bằng, a town in the northern province of the same name. Pizza Chi broke all the rules (Western food made by a local in a non-touristy place can almost guarantee a horror show), but it was a sublime discovery. The crust: Call me crazy, but I don't really believe in thin crust vs. thick crust. I believe in the right crust. It should be thin enough that I get more than just a mouthful of bread with a dab of flavor, but thick enough to be a sturdy and worthy vessel for the toppings. It should have a good balance of chew and crispness, with a blackened blister or two on the bottom. This was the right crust, and made in a wood burning oven (with local wood) no less. Perfection. The sauce: Namely, it wasn't a sugar bomb like it often is in Vietnam. It's made daily and is pure tomato-y goodness, applied with a light hand. Also, it wasn't a sugar bomb. Did I mention it wasn't a sugar bomb? The cheese: A combination of mozzarella and parmesan (note: not the same as parmigiano-reggiano). This cheese is not going to take you to another plane of existence, but, again, it's applied with a perfect hand. The toppings: Ground beef and pineapple (the Bo Bam). It sounds odd, but the combination is better than the traditional Hawaiian ham and pineapple. Also of note was the pepperoni pizza made with local Cao Bằng sausage -- absolutely nothing like pepperoni but fusion cooking at its finest. The topping distribution here is perfect -- not so heavy as to sink the crust, but liberal enough to make every bite a good, balanced one. The garnishes: Pickled hot peppers and garlic, a ubiquitous add-on in Vietnam for all kinds of dishes but especially soup. The tang from the pickling liquid and the heat from the peppers makes this pizza sing. Pizza Chi was a revelation. We ate there every night we spent in Cao Bằng and once for breakfast, though sadly we had to settle for other dishes, as the oven was not ready yet. The owner, who named the restaurant after his daughter, is a lovely, hardworking guy. We had a blast talking shop with him, learning about his technique, and exchanging ideas on business, life, and, of course, pizza. I won't go so far as to say you should visit Cao Bằng just to eat this pizza. There is, after all, a stellar waterfall nearby as well as some cool caves. Who am I kidding... go for the pizza, and tell them Wanderrlust sent you. "
FOOD,How to Make Homemade Marshmallow Peeps,"The world wants us to make Peeps. I discovered this on a day that began with reading an article in the local paper in which Marilyn Hagerty called a Ruby Tuesday one of the stars in the restaurant scene of my new town. It was a day I almost gave up on food. On top of all of that, I had an all-around bad feeling about finding appropriate Peep-making tools following a string of failed attempts to locate recipe supplies in North Dakota. Brisket was only available frozen, daikon was nearly nonexistent, tapioca balls cost a fortune. It’s a tough life sometimes, the small town one. But then, I found myself in an actual DIY Peeps section in my two local stores. As I stood there going back and forth between the metal mold and the two (two!) silicone varieties, I thought I might be dreaming. I debated whether it would be a cop-out to spend money on a mold rather than trying to perfect my piping skills. But then I remembered why I hadn’t tried making Peeps before: I never wanted to ruin a batch of marshmallow batter by failing to pipe perfect Peeps. I cringed at the thought of going through the mess of homemade marshmallows only to come out with ugly blobs. I wanted a surefire way to make perfect Peeps on the first try. I wanted that mold. I needed that mold. Is this what good marketing is? So I took home the silicone bunny-and-chick mold and tested all of the possible ways I could imagine myself making Peeps: with the mold, a cookie cutter, or freehand piping. The mold proved the most consistent way every time, but if you can't find one -- or you're up for the challenge of hand-piping your peeps -- there are plenty of tutorials online. Because I took the easy route and used a mold, I was left with plenty of brainpower to think up odd flavors: Matcha worked, Sriracha didn’t. I even used Campari, which proved to be a boozy success."
FOOD,Werewolf in Napa: How the Moon Affects Wine,"It tugs at the tide, boosts plant growth, and helps put us to sleep, but can it really influence the way we taste wine? For centuries, mystics have turned to the moon to guide them. Its phases have served as a reference point for sailors, doctors, farmers, and now... wine lovers? Spend a few days around wine industry insiders and you're sure to hear the word biodynamic tossed around in conversation. Though the word rings of scientific study, it's really more of a blend between agriculture and astrology. Biodynamics provide a unified approach to agriculture that relates the ecology of the earth-organism to that of the entire cosmos, according to the Association of Biodynamic Farming and Gardening. But what does that mean to us? It means we should look to the moon. Biodynamic practices are based on the belief that the best wines are produced when vineyard tasks -- planting, pruning, harvesting etc. -- coincide with specific dates of the lunar calendar. And though these practices have long since been used to govern the production of wine, there are some biodynamic believers who insist that the moon also impacts how a wine tastes. After all, the moon affects the world's oceans, plant growth, and even our bodies... why should a bottle of wine be any exception? Maria Thun, biodynamic researcher and full-on believer, created her first biodynamic calendar in the 1950s, which was used to direct farmers to the best time to plant their crops. More recently, she created When Wine Tastes Best 2014: A Biodynamic Calendar for Wine Drinkers, which was released on November 1, 2013. According to her wine drinking guide, and the school of mystic science behind it, the year is broken down into four types of days: fruit, flower, leaf, and root days. Not every day is created equal, certainly not when it comes time to fill up your wine glass. The key to deciphering a biodynamic calendar is knowing the characteristics of each day:  Fruit days are ideal days to uncork a bottle of wine. Wines tend to express ripe, full fruit notes and appear full-bodied and rich in the mouth. Flower days are generally considered neutral. They bring out aromatic floral notes particularly in white wines, and are the second-most auspicious days for wine drinking. Leaf days tend to emphasize a wine's earthiness and minerality, so much so that the wine is thrown into imbalance. Root days can derail a wine tasting altogether. Wines tend to be closed, unexpressive, and flat, as though someone had turn downed the volume of the wine tasting experience."
FOOD,"Everything Chunk Eats in The Goonies, From Pepsi to Pizza","Last week at a Bon Appétit editorial meeting, someone casually mentioned that a sequel to The Goonies, the beloved movie about quirky, lovable, treasure-seeking kids, was in the works. I had never seen the 1985 classic, but listened in as my colleagues waxed poetic about their love of the film. Since this is a food publication, much of their talk swirled around how much Chunk (Jeff Cohen) consumes throughout the film -- apparently, a lot. It was decided that, for my own personal emotional development, I would have to watch the film closely and count each and every one of Chunk's culinary escapades. I vowed to be vigilant. So, last night, that is what I did. Before starting the film, I shot off a quick email to my editor -- what was the name of the character I was supposed to be watching? I had forgotten. He wrote back in one word: Chunk. Pizza and some milk (in a Pepsi cup) Our first food sighting! Chunk's playing video games at an arcade when a high speed chase whips by. In his excitement (Oh, a police chase!) Chunk runs to the window and slams his pizza -- which looks very heavy on the tomato sauce -- and jostles his cup, spilling milk all over the glass, and himself. Chunk is upset. I would be too. Now, I must note here it seems a milkshake would be the obvious beverage of choice. I rewound the DVD four times, and can safely conclude that if it is not indeed a cup of milk, it is a very poorly made shake. Pepsi and potato chips Okay, we are introduced to a character named Mouth (Corey Feldman -- awesome), who rolls up to Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand's (Josh Brolin, looking fine as ever) house with a can of Pepsi in hand, then helps himself to a handful of chips. I feel conflicted about whether or not I should include this in the roundup, as it's not explicitly Chunk. But it feels... important. The truffle shuffle The truffle shuffle. I have heard about this, and now I understand it. There are neither ganache-covered chocolates nor foraged fungi; the only shuffling is of Chunk's ample belly. I know it's meant to be cruel, but kid pulls it off. Godfather's pizza Chunk's relaying the story of the police chase to the gang -- but no one seems to believe him because Chunk is apparently a pathological liar. I bet it was even more amazing than the time you ate your weight in Godfather's Pizza, says Mouth. Well, I personally believe him. Chunk eats potato chips. You know, I think they made me lose my appetite. Whipped cream Oh God, am I depressed, Chunk mutters as he squirts canned whipped cream directly into his mouth. Good to know we're not the only emotional eaters around here. Guys, I'm hungry. I know when my stomach growls, there's trouble. Hungry for adventure, amirite? Now I'm gonna be late for dinner, and my mom's gonna yell at me. And she's not gonna let me eat my dinner, and she's gonna punish me. Chunk would like some chocolate Anybody got a candy bar? A Baby Ruth? I am disappointed by this, because I have always found Baby Ruth candy bars to be unsatisfyingly dry, and would almost always choose a Snickers over one. Soda pop! Oh boy, am I thirsty! And then, upon finding the vending machine empty, Damn it. It is a Pepsi machine, and I am starting to realize which soft drink manufacturer bought product-placement rights to this film. In a flurry of anxiety, Chunk describes a car as having bullet holes the size of matzo balls! Mikey, come on. It's dinner time, our parents are worried… Sloth (John Matuszak) growls in the distance, and poor Chunk gets blamed: Chunk, I hope that was your stomach, says Stef (Martha Plimpton). As Mikey tries to dig for the buried treasure, Mouth suggests: Listen, why don't we just pour chocolate all over the floor and let Chunk eat his way through! Mouth, you are officially a bully. I smell ice cream... They've got pralines and cream, they've got Mississippi mud, and they got chocolate eruption, and they got apple, and they got grape. They got grape, and super duper chocolate eruption, and... Holy hell. The bad guys return -- with pizza. Chunk's driven wild: Pizza... pepperoni, he whispers feverishly. Sloth is feeding Chunk the Baby Ruth. There is much kissing (from Sloth) and crying (from Chunk). It feels, still, important to the development of their relationship. I've heard that this is kind of an epic scene. I now understand why. And I want ice cream. Well, geez. That was a thrilling couple of hours! (Spoiler alert!) Treasure has been collected, the bad guys have been captured, and the Goonies have been rescued. Chunk's mother is there to greet him, on the beach, with a box of Domino's Pizza, your favorite! I feel happy for Chunk. I feel relieved. It's been ages since we've seen or heard Chunk salivate over junk food. I'm getting worried. Is he okay? Scared? Hungry? What I ate while watching this movie: Two glasses of rosé, half a kabocha squash, an entire head of kale (I am not ashamed), and a handful of pecans."

FOOD,An Abundance of Easter Peeps,"Friends and acquaintances send me images of marshmallow bunnies and chicks dressed as bikers, in police lineups and pole dancing, atop cakes and swimming in vodka. I've seen photos of Peeps jewelry, swimsuits and shift dresses, Peeps topiaries and centerpieces. And I have been sent -- and watched -- each and every video starring marshmallow Peeps. People, friends and those I barely know, come across anything to do with marshmallow Peeps and they immediately think of me. Since moving to Europe close to thirty years ago, the list of what I really miss from home has at once narrowed and deepened. Leave your home country and settle elsewhere, settle in a place where all those familiar comforts of childhood, comforts that you grew up with, just do not exist, and one of two things happens: either you forget them and they fade into some distant memory, quickly to be replaced by the new and the local, everything from comfort foods to holiday rituals. Or suddenly something that you took for granted, or was a tiny, insignificant part of something larger suddenly becomes necessary and you don't want to be, cannot be without it. Suddenly the thing becomes magnified, the craving overpowers you and the approach of a birthday, a holiday or a season can bring the desire rushing to the surface. And suddenly the enjoyment of birthdays, the holiday festivities or the seasonal rituals are incomplete without it. And so it happened to me. Every year, as Easter approaches and the babble around the food blogosphere is all about the celebrations, the cakes and cookies, the Easter baskets and egg hunts, the decorations and the main course, my mind wanders to the special treats of my youth that only appeared at holiday time. And growing up in a Jewish home in which Easter was not celebrated, the candies and sugary confections associated with these holidays became, like forbidden fruit, that much more special. Marshmallow Peeps, from the garish yellow chicks to the white bunnies and chocolate-covered everything, had long ago become a favorite springtime treat, something I would beg my mother to buy each time we passed the Easter display at the grocery store. Living so far from home, the sensation is almost Pavlovian: spring breaks through the winter grey and floats through the open windows; the botanic garden bursts into bloom and the wisteria hangs in elegant mauve and pale violet swags from fences around the city and I crave marshmallow Peeps. A mention or two on Facebook and the offers begin to flood in: Can I send you Peeps? and Let me have your address and I'll send you Peeps! And how often have I said yes? Every year. And then it all came to a head when Colleen and Stacey who represent the Marshmallow PEEPS folks themselves sent me ten pounds... yes, ten pounds of marshmallow Peeps! Yellow, turquoise, purple and pink, chicks and bunnies, vanilla cream, strawberry cream, raspberry and chocolate mousse, chocolate dipped and chocolate encased, Peepster bite-sized cream-filled chocolates, Peeps Pops and milk chocolate eggs filled with, yes, a marshmallow chick! And of course as I mentioned this tremendous treasure trove, this windfall of marshmallow and chocolate Easter treats, this Peeps bonanza to my friends... the images and videos and ideas came flooding in. And so in our marshmallow Peeps abundance -- for I know you all have a weakness for this classic chewy treat -- I leave you with some wonderful and fun ideas for those Peeps that surely are stacking up in your home right about now. Peeps holds the record for being the #1 selling non-chocolate candy at Easter for more than 20 years! "

FOOD,Burger King Hatches Chicken Big King,"Burger King is introducing the Chicken Big King, a further evolution of the Big King burger it unveiled last November and then increased in size in February. The new sandwich's build remains the same as with the previous two iterations -- with lettuce, pickles, onions, American cheese and King sauce on a three-layer, toasted sesame-seed bun -- just with two of the crispy chicken patties it uses for the Rodeo Chicken Sandwich on its King Deals Value Menu. The only build change is that three bun faces get a schmear of sauce, rather than two as with burgers, to keep the chicken moist. The original and bulked-up Big King burgers were priced at $3.69. The Chicken Big King (above) comes in under that at $3.59. The sandwich will be included in Burger King's ongoing 2 for $5 promotion. That has been very good for us, Alex Macedo, Burger King North America president, told BurgerBusiness.com in an interview. It has been a way for us to bring product news and product innovation to consumers at good value. TV advertising support launches on Saturday (4/19) when the sandwich begins rolling out to Burger King stores. Macedo said a multi-faceted digital-media push for the Chicken Big King will debut in a few weeks. And before the gripes that the Chicken Big King is like McDonald's Big Mac or a clone of KFC/Canada's double-decker Big Boss sandwich, understand that Macedo and Burger King don't care about copycat calls. Why not use a good idea? There's no point in not offering your guests something they like and appreciate, he said. With the Big King we took a familiar platform and we serve it with the fire-grilled taste everyone loves about Burger King. Sales have been strong, which tells us it was a good thing to offer to our guests. And with the Chicken Big King, we're taking that platform and innovating on it. [The double-decker sandwich] is a widely known platform that has been relatively dormant over the past few years, Macedo said. We brought in the Big King and that created a lot of excitement. Now we're bringing a second round with the Chicken Big King. Using the Rodeo Chicken patty is consistent with Burger King's strategic shift last year to introducing fewer new products and to simplifying kitchen operations. This year, basically, we have introduced only four new products and we have done that with just one new SKU, the spicy chicken patty. A year ago we were introducing a bunch of [new] products with a lot of new SKUs and it was very confusing for our restaurant teams. It was difficult for our franchisees to manage profitability. We took a few steps back and tried to be more creative with on-hand ingredients and that's what we're doing here. That, he says, has improved store operations by adding efficiency and cutting waste. Despite the weather challenges that everyone has had, we're seeing increased profitability for franchisees, which is our ultimate goal. The Chicken Big King was tested in 100 Burger Kings in Indiana. What the consumer told us was, 'Wow. So obvious. How come it's never been done before?' Just with point-of-purchase marketing, consumers understood exactly what they were getting [with the Chicken Big King] because they know that build, said Macedo. If we have the same success [nationally] with the Chicken Big King that we had in test, we're in a really good place. To be fair, the idea has been done before, if not in the U.S. McDonald's has offered a chicken version of its Big Mac as a limited-time special in several markets -- especially in the Middle East and recently in Dubai -- over the past several years. And KFC has the double-decker Big Boss chicken sandwich in Canada. The triple-bun burger dates to Bob Wian and Big Boy restaurants in 1937. McDonald's franchisee Jim Deligatti created the Big Mac in 1967. The Big Mac was untouched until 2009, when McDonald's Canada operation deconstructed it for the Mac Snack Wrap. That innovation came to the U.S. the following year. In 2012, McDonald's Germany created a Bigger Big Mac, 45 percent larger than standard. France last year copied that with Le Grand Mac. McDonald's Japan introduced the four-patty Mega Mac last year and the chain's Australian operation came up with a single-story Angus Mac. McDonald's has not messed with the Big Mac much in the U.S. When the chain used that Big Mac's special sauce on this year's Bacon Clubhouse burger, that alone raised some eyebrows among aficionados."
FOOD,7 Recipes to Cook Sunday and Eat All Week Long,"Now that I'm in my late 20's, the cooking complaint I get most from my friends is that they can't find the time in their busy schedules to make it a daily habit. They have the skill set now, and the money to invest in tricking out their pantry. But time still seems to stand in the way. Even though I primarily work from home and spend a good chunk of the day cooking for a living, I still find myself up against these same challenges. When you're running around like a mad woman, it becomes too easy to justify a Seamless web order just so you have one less thing on your plate to worry about. What people don't realize, and what I often forget, is that cooking is a habit-forming activity -- not at all unlike the gym. The difference is, unlike exercise, there are strategies that allow us to concentrate our cooking workout into one big chunk of time so we can let our bodies enjoy the fruits of our labor for the rest of the week. I usually reserve Sunday nights for me time and that's when I do the majority of my food prepping for the week. It's a great way to decompress and dedicate some time to yourself, even if that time also includes marathons of your favorite bad TV show and/or singing along to Cowgirl Kiss-Off's on songza. In the spirit of my Wellness Wednesday chat last week with Laurie David, and all of her great strategies for making home cooking a habit for your family, I've put together some of my favorite make-ahead dishes.

FOOD,Surprising Drinking Rituals Around the World,"In this country, we're no strangers to drinking, and neither are countries around the world -- so much so that drinking has become a ritualistic pastime. In fact, some drinking rituals may surprise you. When traveling from country to country, you'll likely to discover that each have their own customs -- sometimes quirky -- when it comes to drinking and getting belligerent. Swedes will sing a drinking song before, during and after each round of shots of aquavit, which are followed by a glass of beer. As the shots keep coming, the singing gets louder and more enthusiastic. The Dutch style of drinking genever, a kind of flavored whiskey, is to do it by head butting. To do this, they pour chilled genever in a tulip glass until the drink reaches the very tip of the rim. Bending from the waist, they take a sip, then straighten up and follow with a sip of beer. The head butt is repeated until the drink is gone. Russians have a habit of giving long, story-like toasts with a punch line. And when they've finished a drink, empty glasses go under the table, not on top."
FOOD,"Sorry, Domino's Is Not Serving A Fried Chicken Pizza Crust","The confusion started Tuesday after the chain announced a new menu item called Specialty Chicken. The meal was described as white meat served with a variety of sauces and toppings. Some began referring to the new offering as a pizza with a fried chicken crust. However, that's not quite accurate. In reality, Specialty Chicken is merely a blend of popular pizza toppings and sauces served atop a bed of 12 chicken bites. There is no dough at all. The dish features a combination of four flavors made from pre-existing Domino's pizza ingredients. The flavors are: Crispy Bacon & Tomato, Spicy Jalapeno-Pineapple, Classic Hot Buffalo, and Sweet BBQ Bacon. Our new Specialty Chicken is one of the most creative, innovative menu items we have ever had, Russell Weiner, chief marketing officer for Domino's, said in a press release. Our pizza chefs have taken chicken to a whole new level, using our unique ingredients to create these four bold flavors. There's nothing quite like Domino's Specialty Chicken on the market today. The company seems to be making a wise move by introducing more chicken-centric options on its menu. Prior to the rollout of Specialty Chicken, Domino's CEO, J. Patrick Doyle, told USA Today that chicken is the chain’s second best-selling item (next to pizza, of course). Domino's appears to think it’s onto something with this seemingly outrageous idea, but it also acknowledges that similar ventures have failed in the past.

FOOD,9 Foods That Were The Happiest Accidents,"Great food can take careful planning, perfect timing and meticulous execution. It can also be a total accident. Some of our favorite foods, in fact, were born of unforeseen circumstances, by improvisation or by total mistake. Did you know, for example, that potato chips were an unintentional product of a chef trying to prepare French fries to a customer's liking? It's no secret that some of life's greatest inventions were actually accidents, and we couldn't be more grateful for these accidental food inventions. At age 11, Frank W. Epperson invented the popsicle by accident. It was 1905, and Epperson put a mixing stick in a cup of soda-water powder and water and left it on his porch overnight. The next morning he found the mixture frozen. He later patented his accidental creation as a handled, frozen confection or ice lollipop. In 1930, a woman named Ruth Wakefield invented the chocolate chip cookie by accident, and changed the lives of Americans and milk drinkers forever. Along with her husband, she owned a tourist lodge called Toll House Inn, and one day when she was trying to make cookies for guests, she realized she had run out of the baker's chocolate she typically used. She threw in broken up pieces of Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate instead, assuming the chocolate would melt and spread out in the batter. We all know what happened next. The chips didn't spread, and chocolate chip cookies were born. While the origin of this dish is disputed, one story starts in 1895 with a 14-year-old assistant waiter at a cafe Monte Carlo. His name was Henri Charpentier. One day when Charpentier was preparing dessert for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of England, the dessert accidentally caught fire. What followed was an amazing mix of flavors and what became one of the most popular crepe dishes of all time. In his autobiography, Charpentier wrote of the incident: It was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought I was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious melody of sweet flavors I had every tasted. 1958 was a fateful year for frozen beverages: Omar Knedlik, a Kansas-based Dairy Queen owner, accidentally invented the Slurpee. Because Knedik's Dairy Queen franchise didn't have a fountain, he received shipments of soda that would often go in the freezer to keep cool. Sometimes he left them in the freezer too long and it turned out that customers actually liked the sodas when they were partially frozen. What started as an accidental item turned into an enormously popular one -- so popular, in fact, that Knedik built a new machine to keep up with demand. The ICEE dispenser was born and by the mid-1960s 300 companies, including 7-Eleven, had bought it. In 1965 7-Eleven struck a deal with the ICEE company and renamed ICEEs sold at 7-Eleven locations Slurpees. In 1898, brothers W.K. Kellogg and Dr. John Harvey Kellogg were working in a sanitarium in Michigan. They were trying to find healthy food to serve to their patients and when they accidentally let some boiled wheat go stale, they decided to see what they could do with the product. When they tried rolling the hardened dough it cracked into flakes, which the brothers then toasted. The patients liked the toasted flakes so much that the brothers started experimenting with other grains. Corn was an instant success. Thus corn flakes came into being, changing breakfast forever. In his book, How the Hot Dog Found its Bun, Josh Chetwynd explains two origin stories for pink lemonade. One story claims that a circus concession stand worker named Pete Conklin ran out of water to make lemonade one night. He went to look for more water and found a bucket in the circus' dressing room. The water was dyed pink because a woman named Fannie Jamieson had just used it to clean her pink stockings. Chetwynd used the water for his lemonade and sold it as fine strawberry lemonade. The second tale also recounts an accident: Henry E. Allott, another circus-worker, unintentionally dropped cinnamon candles into a vat of lemonade and sold the rose-colored beverage to widespread acclaim. However pink lemonade originated, we're happy it has become a summertime staple. At the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, an ice cream seller named Arnold Fornachou was selling so much ice cream that he ran out of cups. Luckily, a man named Syrian Ernest Hamwi, who was selling pastries nearby, decided to come to Fornachou's rescue. Hamwi rolled up the waffle-like pastry he was selling and gave it to Forachou for his ice cream. The first waffle cone was an instant hit. Potato chips were born accidentally from an unsatisfied customer and an angry but complicit chef. The story goes that a diner at the Moon Lake Lodge in Saratoga Springs in New York complained to the chef one day that his French fries were too thick. The chef, George Crum, sliced and fried up a new batch of thinner potatoes, but they were still too thick for the customer. Frustrated but willing, Crum sliced a third batch of potatoes but this time cut them as thin as he could get them. The customer loved the result and the thin, crispy potato chips we all know and love were born: unintentional, but oh so welcome. Worcestershire sauce, a familiar but also puzzling ingredient (see here if you want to know when you're actually supposed to use the stuff ) was another happy accident. According to legend, a nobleman returned to England from India and hired two chemists, John Lea and William Perrins, to recreate a spice recipe that he had really liked on his stint abroad. The chemists didn't like the concoction they came up with, and left it in jars in the cellar. A few years later, they rediscovered the sauce and found that the fermenting that took place while it was stashed away turned the sauce into a savory delight. "
FOOD,These American Meat Products Are Banned Abroad,"Next time you're enjoying a plate of giant Buffalo wings or chowing down on a giant steak, think about the size of the animal that must have produced it. Have you ever noticed how much bigger some U.S. cows, chickens, and turkeys are than their European counterparts? That's because many of America's animal farms actually mix in synthetic hormones with the feedstock, making their cows, pigs, and other animals grow a lot bigger and faster than they usually would. While the practice has been given the thumbs up by the Food and Drug Administration, many overseas countries feel that the resultant meat and meat products are not all that safe for human consumption and disapprove of the practice. For this reason, and several others, a handful of common U.S. meat products are actually banned from sale abroad. American beef is a prime example of meat being treated with a variety of hormones that have placed it on the banned list for several countries since 1993. U.S. chicken also makes an appearance on the banned list for being washed with chlorine. (It kills some the dangerous pathogens the chickens absorb while they're crammed into the tight quarters of their feeding pens.)  Believe it or not, a lot more of your favorite American foods might actually be banned from being sold abroad. That big slice of papaya with your morning breakfast, for example, may have been genetically altered to make it bigger and shinier and so it's banned in Europe, Japan, and several other countries that have strict rules about the sale of GE (genetically engineered) foods. There are also plenty of food additives like Olestra, or Olean (found in potato chips), or bromated flour (commonly used in baking), or even popular food colorings like red dye #40 and yellow dye #6 (check your food labels to see how often they show up in the listed ingredients), that are widely used in American foods and beverages, from candies to sodas to vegetable oil, which are banned in most other countries. Now, before you panic, food manufacturers who are using these additives and hormones are not necessarily trying to poison you -- some additives preserve the life of the food if it's meant to be stored for a long time, and the hormones allow more meat to be sold to meet the demands of a growing hungry population. Often, the FDA weighs the health concerns against agricultural demands and decides it's worth it, even if the European Union (with much stricter food processing laws) often doesn't agree. Take a look at our list of some of the American meat products that are banned abroad and see if you agree. Much of the U.S. beef cattle are fed synthetic hormones in the feedlots prior to slaughter. The chemicals are essentially growth hormones meant to increase the net amount of meat produced from each cow, but numerous concerns have been raised (by the National Cancer Association, no less) about the high incidence of hormonal cancers produced as well. As early as 1989, the EEC (European Economic Community) put its collective foot down and said that’s not okay, and banned the treated beef from being sold in any E.U. country, though some of those restrictions have since relaxed depending on the hormones used. There have also been other issues like mad cow disease, leading to China also banning American beef products. Ironically, the U.S. has banned much of the Europe’s beef products, too, because of mad cow disease. Pigs, Cows, and Turkeys Fed Ractopamine Safety have slammed the U.S. for its continued use of ractopamine saying it can cause anxiety and an increased heart rate in humans. As noted by the FDA, it can also increases injury and lameness in pigs. The U.S.’s position is that the use of ractopamine favors agricultural trade over the health risks. As overfishing of our oceans is a serious environmental concern, the U.S. errs in favor of farmed salmon for mass consumption. However, like many other American meat products, farmed salmon is raised on a concoction of grain, antibiotics, and other drugs rendering it not at all as wholesome as we may think it is. Factory-farmed fish are intensively confined and are fed a steady diet of antibiotics and other drugs to combat the unnatural and squalid conditions of the pens. This often results in gray-colored flesh, which is then counteracted by dosing the fish with synthetic astaxanthin made from petrochemicals — which is banned in Australia and New Zealand. Last year the FDA finally admitted that American chicken meat contained cancer-causing arsenic. Despite the fact that arsenic is a well-known toxin and carcinogen it’s often added to chicken feed in the U.S. to help promote growth and kill parasites. In 1999, serious health concerns prompted the European Union to ban arsenic-based feed additives. Even some states, like Maryland, have pushed back on using arsenic in the feedstock — but, by and large, it’s still widely used. Generally speaking, American-raised chickens are bred in incredibly cramped conditions. Thousands of birds are literally stuffed inside massive warehouses and spend their lives standing, sleeping, and eating in their own waste. It makes sense then, that the meat picks up a lot of pathogens. After the chickens are slaughtered, they’re washed in chlorine to rid them of some of nastiest germs. The European Union is not having it. Convinced the process is dangerous to humans because the chlorine likely lingers in the meat, they’ve banned these chemical baths across the E.U. They’ve also banned the chlorine-bathed chicken from the U.S., to boot. Some of the mercurial concoctions of growth hormones that are routinely pumped into U.S. meat products are not just constrained to the meat alone. rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone), for example, is commonly fed to cows to dramatically increase milk production. While legal in the U.S. since being approved by the FDA in 1993, rBGH is not permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and the entire European Union due to human health concerns."
FOOD,Aquitaine | Bordeaux: Left Bank v. Right Bank,"I'd like to share our journey through France by way of wine. In January we began in Southwest France, where we explored the wines of Aquitaine. We featured a selection of the following wines and pairings, representing the area of Southwest France. Subtle touch of peach and mango, this wine has attracted attention for the quality of its bouquet, which reveals scents of white flowers and citrus. Reveals in the mouth freshness and complexity that combine delicious fluency and ease of drinking. Concentrated, suave wine with marked minerality and impeccable balance. Medium-bodied juicy red wine exhibiting subtle hints of black currant, fresh plums and blackberries. The character of Château Cahuzacs' wines are largely due to the Negrette varietal, which is indigenous and unique to this corner of southwest France. High quality Bordeaux built for everyday drinking. This medium-bodied wine offers notes of herbs, tobacco, savory, black cherry, cassis, toasty oak, cedar and bell pepper. Madiran is a Southwest France appellation known for powerful red wines made primarily from the Tannat varietal. Chateau Fitère has been in the same family since 1760, and Marius Fitère was the leader in the creation of the Madiran Appellation in 1948. Strong tannic wine. Our next stop will continue our journey through Aquitaine, into Bordeaux, where we will explore the wines of the Left Bank, Right Bank and Entre-deux-mers. What does that means for us? Luscious, velvety wine from the largest wine growing area in France. Varietals: Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cab Franc, Merlot, Petite Verdot, and Malbec Soil: Limestone under rocky top soil Popular Appellations: Medoc, Graves, Sauternes, St. Estephe, Paulliac, Margaux, St. Julien Quick Fact: Graves is considered the birthplace of Claret Entre-deux-mers literally translates to between two seas and is a dry white wine made in Bordeaux. Don't get confused however, there are several red wine producing appellations within this area.

FOOD,You Probably Don't Want To Know What's Actually In Public School Chicken Nuggets,"Turns out the chicken nuggets being served in one of the nation's largest public school districts don't contain much actual chicken at all. Earlier this month, Chicago-based WBEZ food reporter Monica Eng reported that her attempt -- made via a Freedom of Information Act request -- to retrieve an ingredient list for the chicken nuggets served in Chicago Public Schools cafeterias was met with a curt response after weeks of delays: The lone ingredient of a chicken nugget was a chicken nugget, the district wrote. After the Illinois Attorney General's office intervened, CPS -- which reportedly did not know the ingredients of the nuggets its caterer Aramark serves to district students -- released the list of 28 ingredients making up the processed nuggets, minus their breading. Considering about 84 percent of CPS students qualify for either free or reduced-price lunch and 87 percent of the district's approximately 400,000 students come from low-income families, it's likely that far too many CPS students get all their meals for any given weekday at school. And those meals, Eng reports in a followup published Monday, remain dominated by high-sugar processed food with little to no nutritional value while some caterers say low funding is to blame for the limited options available to students."

FOOD,The Only Matzo Toffee Recipe You'll Ever Need,"As I've learned, almost all non-Jews love Matzo. I, being non-Jewish, absolutely love matzo. It's a giant tablewater cracker just waiting for a smear of cream cheese, maybe a little lox. It's the perfect neutral vessel for a nice, triple crème cheese. With a little butter and pinch of good salt, maybe a crack of freshly ground pepper, it's divine. Of course, as many of my Jewish friends point out, I only love matzo because afterwards, beforehand, and sometimes even along with my matzo snacks, I am eating pasta, rice, leavened bread, and washing it all down with a nice grain-based drink. For us non-Jews, matzo is a nice yearly alternative to the Wasa cracker or toast. But eat nothing but matzo for a week and chances are that lovely dry, charred cardboard taste will pop up. Over the decades, perhaps even centuries, many an ingenious grandmother, and probably a few grandmothers, grandfathers, and fathers, have come up with the perfect encasement for matzo. Matzo Toffee. As we all know, take anything and add caramel, and you just created something closely resembling crack. Not the most holy of substances, but hey. It sure is addicting. Kosher too. Crack has recently become a popular adjective to describe food, and as our friends over at the National Institute on Drug Abuse have found, food is more addictive than many drugs. Granted, we all need food while very few of us need a little more crack cocaine in our lives. Regardless how ironic the comparison, you'll find that with a jar of matzo toffee on the table, it disappears more quickly than you would have imagined. Thanks to the subtle honey tones in the toffee, the richness of the chocolate, and the natural lusciousness of the nuts, matzo toffee does not simply mask the matzo, it plays off all its best qualities. Neutral in flavor, thin, brittle and crunchy, you've never had matzo this addictive. 5-6 pieces of matzo 1/2 cup nuts, like macadamia, sliced almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc. 1 cup chocolate chips, milk or dark cups white sugar cup, (1 stick), unsalted butter cup honey Pinch salt"
FOOD,Berry Coconut Frozen Yogurt: Leftovers Achieve Their Full Potential,"Berry Coconut Frozen Yogurt is the flirty little sundress of desserts -- pretty, pink, and ready to play lawn games in the sun. I owe this sweet little number to the bright, happy things in half-empty containers that littered my fridge: straggling berries at the brink of over-ripeness; a scrap of jam I was saving for a small piece of toast (or midnight graham cracker dunk); a half-empty can of coconut milk. I hate throwing food away, not only because I find it wasteful, but also because I feel that by doing so, I have given up on its potential. No flipping burgers for my lagging spoonful of jam and orphan coconut milk-their future is beaming with Berry Coconut Frozen Yogurt! Though simple stir fries and creamy quiches are my usual outlets for repurposing extra ingredients, these savory dishes cannot rescue me where sweet leftovers are concerned (though if anyone has a quiche recipe that calls for excess peanut butter glaze, I'll venture a bite). A few weeks ago, I checked out the ice cream Bible from the library, and in it, author King David David Lebovitz mentions that he often uses ice cream as a vehicle for the excess dessert bits he has strewn about his kitchen from the week's assorted baking projects. Besides prompting me to declare David Lebovitz's apartment a place I could exist quite happily, this idea struck me as brilliant. I often top my leftover caramel brownies with ice cream, but for some reason, the idea that I could put them in the ice cream itself never occurred to me. Life hack. Also, I'm slow. I decided to apply David's turn it into ice cream principle to the sweet leftovers in my fridge, and oh my lans -- I may never do another thing with them again. My little ice cream (or in today's case, frozen yogurt) experiment demonstrates that coconut milk pureed with Greek yogurt and leftover berries creates a perfect, 30-second custard, and a smidge of jam contributes extra fruity oomph. The remainder of our sweetness comes from a squeeze of natural honey. The initial fruit coconut milk Greek yogurt honey combo left me with a wonderful berry frozen yogurt, but I wanted the coconut flavor to shine too. Enter toasted coconut flakes, both mixed in and served atop our Berry Coconut Frozen Yogurt. And coconut rum too. A few tablespoons of booze helps keep the frozen yogurt soft (alcohol has a lower freezing point). Plus, coconut rum. Tropics, here we come!"
FOOD,6 International Beer Fests You Should Hit This Year,"You've soaked in suds, slept in a beer barrel, and sought out the cheapest brews on the planet. Not to mention, seriously contemplated drinking space beer -- in outer space! So what can you possibly do for this year's big beercation? How about hitting one (or more) of these six international beer fests? Canada's largest brew fest draws 100k over five days with 500 beers, meads, and ciders from 120 breweries. The École de Biérologie MBière conducts workshops -- lending the festival an air of sophistication -- while vendors grill up exotic meats (deer, kangaroo, bison) alongside traditional Montreal staples like poutine and smoked meat sandwiches. Asia's largest beer celebration takes place in a town casually known as the Munich of China, which makes sense considering it was once a German colony, and remains home to the original Tsingtao factory, which opened in 1903. Annually, dozens of famous breweries the world over descend on Qingdao's sandy beaches for this 16-day Asian Oktoberfest, complete with parades, carnivals, and drinking contests -- not to mention tons of karaoke. Brush up on your English accent before crossing the pond for the UK's largest brewfest, a five-day, 900+ suds affair hosted by the Campaign for Real Ale. Rocking a circus theme this year, expect 350 British brewers and 50,000 thirsty revelers across two grand halls. Also, they're bringing back Hat Day, so don't forget to pack your finest bowler."
FOOD,Olive Oil-Thyme Bundt Cake With Candied Meyer Lemon Peels and Citrus Compote,"Who doesn't love the look of a Bundt cake? They're so dramatic and elegant that they make your mouth water in an instant! But this Bundt cake is not just about its looks. It delivers on flavor too... in spades! Here, extra virgin olive oil is used instead of butter and cream, lending subtle grassy aromas to the cake -- aromas intensified by a dash of fresh thyme added to the batter. To complement these earthy flavors, a drizzle of fresh Meyer lemon juice and candied Meyer lemon peels are added. The cake is incredibly moist and light, and packed with the essence of fresh green olives and lemons. A vibrant citrus compote, served on the side, completes the package. This Bundt cake is ideal for a holiday meal or a special occasion, and it will definitely serve a crowd -- twelve portions with plenty left over for seconds!

FOOD,"15 Different, Delicious Ways To Interpret Greek Salad","There's a lot to love about Greek food -- all those filo pastries, for one -- but mostly, it's the salads that are so special. One salad in particular, the one we lovingly refer to as the Greek salad (and what the Greeks call Horiatiki Salata), has captured our hearts and stomachs. And it's easy to understand why: it's full of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and FETA. There's no wrong way to eat a Greek salad, and no limit to the number of ways you can do it, either. Greek salad is great on pizza, in pasta and as grilled cheese sandwiches, too. Pretty much everything can be given a Greek salad treatment. See for yourself"
FOOD,Easter Haystack Cupcakes,"If, like me, you don't think you'll have time to prepare anything for Easter this year, this recipe will save the day! I'm making a batch of tasty haystacks using dark chocolate and shredded wheat. By placing them into paper cupcake liners the haystacks look like adorable little bird's nest cupcakes. But unlike cupcakes, these babies don't require you to spend more than 10 minutes in the kitchen. That's even faster than the time it would take to run to the nearest store and buy something for Easter. So what are you waiting for? You better hop to it! Place the cupcake liners on a baking sheet. Using your hands, crush the shredded wheat biscuits into thread-like pieces in a bowl. Place the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and melt on medium-high heat. Be sure to stir the chocolate every 15 seconds, until it's smooth. Add the crushed shredded wheat to the chocolate and stir until it is well coated. Using a cookie scoop, place tablespoon-size stacks of the mixture into the cupcake liners. Place several of the chocolate eggs in the center of each nest. Place them in the refrigerator to cool for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm. Remove the nests from the refrigerator about twenty minutes before serving."
FOOD,Alice Medrich's Passover Rocky Road,"This chewy, crunchy, sweet, and slightly salty chocolate treat takes only 10 minutes of prep and 10 minutes in the fridge. And you can make individual clusters or one large sheet to cut up. If you know how to temper chocolate, go ahead and temper it properly before folding the other ingredients into it. Otherwise, this recipe includes my cheater's method: The chocolate is simply melted and cooled to 90° F with plenty of stirring. Nine times out of ten, it ends up tempered (or close enough!) by the time the other ingredients are thoroughly folded into it! Go figure… And, by the way, large marshmallows always taste better than miniature marshmallows, so it's worth the few extra seconds to cut them up. regular-size marshmallows sheets matzo, broken into bite-size pieces walnut pieces milk or dark chocolate flaky sea salt"
FOOD,These Are the 16 Best Burritos in America,"Beloved for being the most American of all Mexican-American dishes (which all happen to be comprised of the exact same ingredients), the burrito is an apt metaphor for today's United States: We're less a melting pot of cultures than a delicious mound of assimilated ingredients wrapped tightly together and covered in hot sauce. One of the OGs of SF's legendary burrito haven that is the Mission, EF is known for A) having some of the most delicious and consistent burritos in the Bay, with each bite doling out the proper portion of beans, meat, cheese, etc. and B) being a legendary late night stop for drunken revelers, Latin gangstas, and everyone in-between.

FOOD,How to Drink Like You're Rich,"We wouldn't be Liquor.com if we didn't suggest spending your windfall on improvements for your bar. So we've assembled a few high-end drinking optimizations. From the world's most expensive gin to a special gold-plated set of whiskey chillers, your refund will be put to good use with any of these luxe items. (Did you owe the government? Check out our set of cost-saving liquor hacks.)  Cognac lovers rejoiced when this new brand released its first expression—a $50, four-year-old VSOP—18 months ago. But you’ll have to hold on to that refund a little longer to try this luxurious bottling: The sippable blend of eaux-de-vie aged at least 10 years rolls out next month. We got a sneak preview recently and tasted lots of orange and apricot. The cheekily named Balls of Steel are, well, balls of steel, with a special core that packs as much cooling power as six ice cubes. And this special set—only 25 will be sold—features 18-karat-gold-plated spheres in a hand-made alder box. Sounds frivolous, but there’s a good cause behind it: $400 from each set’s purchase price will go to the MD Anderson Cancer Center to help fight testicular cancer. Every two years or so, The Macallan releases an extra-special, ultra-aged Scotch bottled in a custom Lalique crystal container. The most recent—a 62-year-old that went for $25,000—is long gone, but you can capture some of its magic with this luxe whisky. The deeply complex spirit is aged in Spanish sherry casks and packaged in a specially designed decanter, also by Lalique. Normally, gins, even high-end ones, don’t reach the astronomical prices of other spirits. But this precious Dutch spirit is the exception. On top of the standard botanicals, it’s flavored with subtle verbena and rare (and expensive) saffron. Each bottle is individually approved by Carolus Nolet, Sr., the 10th-generation distiller whose family has been making liquor since 1691. If you are—or know somebody—turning 50 this year, we can’t think of a better present than this rich after-dinner sipper. It’s spent the last half-century resting in oak, resulting in a bewilderingly complex array of nutty, spicy and molasses notes and a lingering finish. The new bottling is the first in a series of 50-year-old wines the brand plans to introduce annually. You’ve probably heard of gold- or silver-plated bar tools, but here’s a whole new chemical element, imported from Japan by the bartender-favorite shop Cocktail Kingdom. Titanium is much lighter than the usual stainless steel, making this vessel perfect for drinks that take lots of shaking, like the Ramos Gin Fizz. It’s also super-strong, so it’ll last basically forever. Plus, titanium just sounds cool."
FOOD,Amazing Desserts Around the World You've Never Heard Of,"Whether you're a food fanatic or just have a very sweet tooth, you probably enjoy a good dessert. We're all familiar with the delights of a baked apple pie, or even more international dishes like Italian tiramisu, or Asian green-tea ice cream. But some desserts are still fairly unknown on the global menu even though they are famous in their countries of origin. Some desserts use ingredients that are not easy to come by like attap chee in the Singaporean delicacy ais kacang. Others, like tavuk göğsü from Turkey, use traditional ingredients in surprising ways. Even right here in the U.S., some dessert combinations are as imaginative as they are popular, like the cherpumple from the West Coast. These chocolate and cheese pancakes originated as a street food in Saudi Arabia and its immense popularity soon spread across the Arab world and into Southeast Asia. In Indonesia there are two varieties, a sweet and savory. The sweet version is a thick fluffy pancake filled with chocolate and cheese and topped with crushed peanuts, chocolate rice, and jam. This traditional Malaysian dish, also served in Singapore and Brunei, was originally popular as street food but is now served everywhere from stalls to restaurants to ice cream parlors. It essentially shaved ice with red beans, attap chee (palm seed), sweet corn, grass jelly, and topped with both condensed and coconut milk. It's a multicolored explosion of sweet flavors and the perfect snacking dessert for a hot summer's day. Avocados are plentiful in Brazil and there's no reason they should be reserved for just savory dishes. This treat is an avocado cream pudding — mashed up avocados with milk and sugar. It's often garnished with coconut shavings and lime wedges and is served hot and cold (though more traditionally cold) year-round. Also known as Phirni, this is a traditional North Indian rice pudding with saffron, cardamom, and nuts. The pudding is usually speckled yellow and orange from the saffron, which also gives it an aromatic and spicy quality. Often a fruit pulp (usually mango) is added for more flavor. It's not only delicious but it's also the most expensive cake in the world. Served in the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul, this dessert takes 72 hours to prepare and contains figs, quince, apricot, and pears that have been drowned in Jamaican rum for two years. The topping contains caramel, black truffles and decadent gold leaf (yes, real gold leaf). Many of the world's most amazing desserts are well traveled, traversing continents and cultures while picking-up new flavors along the way. Some of the most complex desserts originated in the Middle East. Adapted from old European dishes but with interesting new regional flavors, the dishes began as street foods before spreading across the world as far as Southeast Asia. Today many of these decadent desserts are enjoyed in both restaurants and home kitchen but one dessert is so richly decadent that it's only served in one hotel restaurant in the world, though it may be worth traveling for if you can afford it."
FOOD,Where to Eat in Orlando Now,"Move over, Mickey, because Orlando's artisanal food scene is miles away from Walt Disney World, not just in distance, but also in sophistication. Here, farm-to-table fare bumps up against big-city cuisine, yielding everything from a taco joint run by a former Nobu chef to a slew of James Beard Award nominees proud to call Orlando home. If you don't have time to explore the dining scene in depth, plan a brief stop at East End Market, a mini version of Seattle's Pike Place Market or San Francisco's Ferry Building. This culinary hub is loaded with Orlando's best and edgiest food and drink purveyors, from Skyebird Juice Bar and Experimental Kitchen's smoothies and coffees served in glass Mason jars to Houndstooth Sauce Company's firey glazes, rubs, and sauces. Located in the upscale enclave of Winter Park, Hamilton's Kitchen is inside the suburb's first luxury boutique hotel, The Alfond Inn. Owned by Rollins College and open since last fall, the 112-room hotel's décor is Hollywood-glam-meets-beach-chic, and the style extends to the food. Gulf Coast seafood features Sarasota sturgeon paired with cheesy-herb fries, and the wine list's depth spans quite a few continents. If faced with a busy itinerary in Orlando, schedule a lunch date at the restaurant -- the hotel's daytime lighting is perfect for viewing its outstanding contemporary art collection, numbering around 100 pieces. Pair your midday meal with a bottle of Moet & Chandon Champagne from France. Order the mac 'n' cheese with local smoked ham, white cheddar, and caramelized onions. It will set the bar high for all future macs. A repeat James Beard Award nominee, Cask & Larder is a home-sweet-home story for owner-couple Julie and James Petrakis. After meeting at the Culinary Institute of America, they returned to Orlando to open The Ravenous Pig six years ago. Cask & Larder, their wildly successful follow-up, opened during the fall of 2012 in Winter Park and features a gastropub menu with upscale, Southern-inspired accents. Corn dogs are made with lobster, snapper crudo is paired with sorghum popcorn, and a side of charred-corn spoon bread comes with a redeye hanger steak. Sides such as charred kale, beans and rice, lobster hush-puppies, and pimento cheese with ham jam on toasted collard bread round out this veritable jaunt to the South. Wash it all down with one of nine craft beers brewed on-site. Save room for the ice-cream sandwiches: chocolate shortbread, salted-caramel semifreddo, and peanut-butter caramel. Housed in an unassuming storefront along bustling West Fairbanks Avenue in Winter Park since November, Scratch's intimate ambiance emulates a cozy Parisian lounge. Co-owner Ashley Byrd fashioned the upholstered banquettes and antique décor, including a shabby-chic sideboard holding an espresso machine. Designed to share with friends, the meat-heavy menu includes sous-vide Lake Meadows pork belly, coq au vin, and lavender-cured, smoked duck breast. Vegetarians can find something to snack on, too; try the sautéed broccolini with garlic, chiles, pine nuts, lemon, and aged cheddar. The scratch fries are a must. Served in a mini deep-fry basket, the fries are doused with fresh oregano and come with a side of saffron aioli. Chef-owner Kathleen Blake's trademark overalls are the talk of the town, and so is her food at downtown Orlando's The Rusty Spoon, which takes its inspiration from London's gastropubs. The Iowa native embraces sustainability in her sourcing, and her menu features Jamison Farm slow-roasted lamb shank and fried local green tomatoes. Also look for one of the handhelds, a collection of sandwiches including a half-pound, grass-fed burger stuffed with bacon and Gruyere. Don't dismiss the starters, as they can be a meal on their own. Try the haystack (shoestring potatoes with a trio of sauces), the butcher's plate (created at the chef's whim), or charred local squid. Orlando's little-known Vietnamese and Chinese community -- dubbed The Mills 50 District -- hosts a no-fuss taco joint where East meets West. Tako Cheena owner Pom Moongauklang, a former pastry chef at Nobu in New York City, designed quick eats such as empanadas, house tacos, Asian hot dogs, and burritos with a multitude of sauces. Innovative recipes include an Indian butter chicken burrito and a taco stuffed with Latin and Asian marinades, shrimp, and slaw. It's open until 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and midnight every night but Monday. To bite into the day's inspiration, spring for a specialty taco, such as Mary Had a Little Tako. Offerings change daily."
FOOD,"This Reuben Sandwich Is Also A Pie, And It's The Best Food Mashup","When it comes to food mashups, the world has seen enough. Between the Cronut and the ramen burger, the general consensus is that the food scene needs to move on. But there is one exception to this sentiment, and that is this: a Reuben sandwich that is also a pie. Yes ladies and gentlemen, possibly the two greatest foods that America loves have been combined into one gutsy dish. The Reuben pie is here; and it is making a good name for food mashups everywhere. If the thought of a Reuben pie makes you feel a little, er, nauseous, there is one thing you should know: it's all baked into a rye pie crust. The pie is filled with corned beef, layered with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese and then topped with Russian dressing. All that is baked into a flaky, buttery, caraway-dotted crust that makes the whole creation perfect -- and the caloric weight of it totally acceptable. This baking feat was created by Cupcake Project who took a break from her unusual cupcake creations to gift us all with this be-all end-all of pies. You can get the Reuben pie recipe here."
FOOD,These Countries Banned McDonald's,"It's hard to think of a country in the world where you'd be surprised to see a McDonald's restaurant, or at least a drive-through offering. The fast food giant is currently listed in 119 countries around the world with more than 34,480 restaurants, which combined, serve an estimated 75 hamburgers every second. That's a lot of hamburgers. You can find McDonald's in some pretty far out locations, too: next to Cuba's Guantanamo Bay prison, in the middle of the Negev Desert in Israel, beneath the Museum of Communism in Prague, and even inside an old grounded airplane in New Zealand. In 2009 Iceland’s currency, the krona, suffered a dismal collapse and all three McDonald’s restaurants in the capital city of Reykjavik were forced to close. While there are no plans to re-open, government officials aren’t keen to have them back either, preferring to look at the possibility of setting-up a local variation-chain (it may be called Metro) with regionally sourced ingredients that would be better for growing their economy in the long run. From Dubai to Abu Dhabi to Oman, there are McDonald’s aplenty in the United Arab Emirates. Yemen, however, is not feasting on any Big Macs, due partly to the dilapidated economy (McDonald’s won’t open a franchise unless it’s economically viable in a territory, which is why the food giant is often used an economic indicator of a country’s wealth and financial stability), and partly because of the occasional threat by religious militants that they will target U.S. establishments in the area. In 1999 McDonald’s tried to build its first restaurant in Bermuda, but the local population pushed back so hard that a law was passed banning all franchised restaurants in the country. It is not Bermudian. McDonald's cheapens wherever it goes, commented 83-year-old Bermudian resident Phyllis Harron, in the local newspaper. Just over ten years ago McDonald’s crept into Montenegro’s capital Podgorica with a tiny mobile restaurant over the summer. It was popular and business was brisk but the government just wasn’t having it! Montenegro has long been resistant to big global brands moving in to dominate the market, which forces out smaller business ventures. It was also concerned with the health of its residents, siding with local restaurants that McDonald’s fast food was too unhealthy and people had bigger things to worry about. The world’s largest landlocked country, located in Central Asia, is also the largest country that’s said no to having McDonald’s. Though that may (or may not) soon be changing — local media in the country’s capital Astana are reporting that a major shopping mall has confirmed the food giant will be moving in soon. Watch this space! Still, McDonald's isn't everywhere; there are scores of countries around the world (mostly in Africa and Central Asia) where the golden arches have yet to set up shop. Then there are some countries that have outright banned the food company from entering its borders altogether. Some countries, like Montenegro, have said no to McDonald's to push back against globalization, i.e. big global brands dominating their market and forcing out smaller franchises. Other countries, like Bolivia, closed down all its McDonalds restaurants, affecting a pseudo-ban because the fast food chain just wasn't profitable. Not that Bolivians don't like hamburgers -- it seems the population was just not sold on the concept of super-fast food. Then there are countries that, after resisting McDonald's best courting rituals for years, finally gave in and let it in. Two months ago, Vietnam opened its first McDonald's in its capital Ho Chi Minh City. This follows the long line of global brands like Starbucks, Subway, Burger King, and Domino's Pizza that have slowly but surely been filtering into Vietnam over the years. No matter what the reason for refusing to allow McDonald's to set up shop, these countries (at least most of them) are still holding firm against the fast food brand for now. Read on to see how many countries have banned McDonald's."

FOOD,"Thank You, Pittsburgh, For The Greatest Cake America Has Ever Made","Living in New York City, we have had the opportunity to eat some really good food. Between the epic chocolate chip cookies from Levain Bakery on the Upper West Side and the famed kouign amann from Dominique Ansel's famed bakery, our delicious sugar daze made us foolish enough to think that we have eaten the best desserts this country has to offer. But then we got our hands on a cake from Prantl's Bakery in Pittsburgh and we realized that we couldn't be more wrong. No cake made in any of the five boroughs of New York holds a candle to Prantl's amazing burnt almond torte. It is probably the BEST cake America has to offer. (And yes, we know there are a lot of great cakes out there.) Just take a look at this beauty: Prantl's burnt almond cake isn't impressive in height. It's not made out of chocolate (which is usually a must). And it isn't trying to push the limits of pastry and redefine what cakes are. It is just a damn good cake -- and taking a bite out of one is like reaching into the sky and stuffing a cloud into your mouth. To say that the burnt almond torte is light and airy doesn't even begin to describe the texture of this cake. It is beyond that. This cake is so airy it tastes like the idea of a cake, one that can only be tasted in the best of dreams. Only it does exist in real life -- in Pittsburgh, PA, to be exact-- and it is frosted with the lightest of buttercreams (of course) and then dressed in candied toasted almonds. The contrast of the sugared almond slivers and the cloud-like cake is EVERYTHING. Oh, and did we mention the thin layer of custard in the middle and the large flakes of sugar on top? This is the kind of cake that will have you belly up to the kitchen counter, forgoing the civility of plates and diving in fingers first.  When Bon Appetit named Pittsburgh the best new food city of 2014, they couldn't have been more right. Only it's not because of the surge of hot new restaurants opening up. No, it's because cakes like this are made there -- and it's time people know about them. If a trip to Pittsburgh is not in the near future, you can still get your hands on this cake because, lucky for you, they deliver."

Announcing a new Doritos Locos Tacos flavor wasn't enough for Taco Bell, either. The chain has also just started testing out Quesadilla Double Dippers. A food taboo most people probably agree is gross, Taco Bell seems to think it's marketing gold. (Is it ever okay to double dip?) The new Quesadilla Double Dipper -- a miniature flour quesadilla stuffed with cheese and beef -- is just a vehicle for two dipping sauces: nacho cheese and crushed bits of Flamin' Hot Fritos. The idea is you dip the quesadilla into the cheese first, and then dip it into the Fritos. The Double Dippers"
FOOD,Visiting A Restaurant? There's A Good Chance It's Googling You,"Before you go to a restaurant, you probably look it up online for some reason or another. Maybe you're making a reservation through the website or maybe you're checking the menu. You might look at photos to see how fancy the place is or maybe you just need to look up the address. What if a restaurant were doing this to you? Restaurants google the names of patrons who've made reservations more often than you might think. In 2010 the subject surfaced to the surprise, amusement and horror of restaurant goers and chefs alike. People were understandably alarmed, but most people didn't seem to care. In a poll conducted by CNN, almost 40 percent of people were okay with restaurants googling them if it meant special treatment, and about 4 percent hoped restaurants would research them. Sixteen percent thought it was a little strange but could live with it, and 15 percent thought it was creepy. Four years later, people haven't forgotten about the prospect of restaurants researching them. On April 9, Grubstreet published an article detailing the lengths famed New York restaurant Eleven Madison Park go to in the name of hospitality. Nothing is overlooked -- dining room pillows are fluffed in a specific way and wine glasses are set on the table according to what else the customer has ordered. Front of house staff must wear socks at a particular height and all nail polish must be approved. The training manual is 97 pages long. Perhaps most importantly for this restaurant that values a personalized experience as much as its etiquette, maître d' Justin Roller googles every single patron that visits Eleven Madison Park. He looks for anything that can help make a customer feel special and at home. If I find out a guest is from Montana, and I know we have a server from there, we'll put them together, Roller told Grubstreet. He doesn't stop at cursory information either. If, for example, Roller discovers it's a couple's anniversary, he'll then try to figure out which anniversary, Grubstreet reports. Restaurants also take notes on customers after they've dined, to track preferences and habits, like if someone is a good or bad tipper. According to the New York Times hundreds of restaurants record traits and preferences about their customers, like allergies, favorite foods and even if a customer likes to linger at the table. These notes are collected under a slew of acronyms, like FOM -- friend of the manager -- or WW -- Wine Whale. Restaurants have always taken note of customers, but with software and websites like OpenTable and Venga, it's easier now than ever before. Restaurant managers claim it's all in the name of superior service, but does it really make you feel more comfortable? Privacy is one of the defining issues of our time -- it seems like every day we uncover new breaches of our personal information and systematic tracking policies. Does it bother you that restaurants are googling you before you even walk through their doors? Or do you welcome the practice for the personalized service you may experience as a result?"
FOOD,10 Royal Recipes for a Game of Thrones Feast,"We have a confession to make. For all our talk of warm-weather eating, we're about to break our cardinal food rule: forget those sunny pastas and springtime veggies -- this weekend, we feast like winter is coming. After the Red Wedding last summer, there's no telling what might happen. Invasion from the north? Revenge of the Starks? (Okay, definitely revenge.) Whatever lies ahead, you can't face it on an empty stomach, so we rounded up the essential dishes for a Westeros-worthy feast. From Tyrion's leg of lamb to Cersei's chestnut stew, our menu draws inspiration from across the continent -- but in true King's Landing fashion, it is an epic, take-no-prisoners spread. Start with bread and salt for your guests, and then dig in. It's going to be a night to remember. When there was a Stark at Winterfell... travelers could find fire, bread, and salt at many an inn and holdfast. But the nights are colder now, and doors are closed. The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine. So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey, not a drop more. Raisins and nuts and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy. Cersei set a tasty table, that could not be denied. They started with a creamy chestnut soup, crusty hot bread, and greens dressed with apples and pine nuts. This evening they had supped on oxtail soup [and] summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red fennel, and crumbled cheese... Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well. A leg of lamb would be nice... Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if that's easier. I try not to be overly particular. [Ben Stark] snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched. Later came sweetbread and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon. Then the steel was at her throat, and its bite was red and cold. Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. Sam loved... to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts."
BUSINESS,"U.S. Launches Auto Import Probe, China Vows To Defend Its Interests","The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March. The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry’s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a thorough, fair and transparent investigation. Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers’ shares across the region. The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests. China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order, Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute. We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests. The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his America First trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors. Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co’s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China’s borders. The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries. In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond. The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States. Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S. internal economy and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes. In a separate statement, Trump said: Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation. A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America, said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries. As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth, a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country. Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent. Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics. At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion. German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany’s biggest source of export income."
BUSINESS,Starbucks Says Anyone Can Now Sit In Its Cafes -- Even Without Buying Anything,"Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores’ restrooms, regardless of whether they’ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain’s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive. We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome, the company said in a statement. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for trespassing on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he’d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they’d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested -- mere minutes after they’d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe’s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer -- whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn’t want to become a public bathroom... we’re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key. We don’t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than, Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank"
BUSINESS,Seattle Passes Controversial New Tax On City's Biggest Companies To Combat Housing Crisis,"Seattle’s city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city’s biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class. Amazon, the city’s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed. As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker. That head tax formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city. Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday’s action. The move by the world’s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs. Following the council vote, Amazon’s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago. However, he added, We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here. The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy."
BUSINESS,"Uber Ends Forced Arbitration In Individual Cases Of Sexual Assault, Harassment","Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company’s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning. Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. It’s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims, West wrote in the post, noting the company’s need to regain the public’s trust. Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit. The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company’s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration. Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber, the women wrote. This is not doing the ‘right thing,’ they said, alluding to the company’s new motto: We do the right thing. Period. The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app’s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation. West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with transparency, integrity, and accountability. Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added. Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform. The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs. [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner, West wrote. Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on. One other tech company -- Microsoft -- has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber’s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year. On Tuesday afternoon, Uber’s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement. Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies, a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to . We agree with the changes. Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they’re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults. The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending. Uber’s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level. Other riders with complaints against the company -- outside the realm of harassment and discrimination -- will still be held to the fine print in the app’s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration. Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company’s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract."
BUSINESS,"Chili's Hit By Data Breach, Credit And Debit Card Information Compromised","The restaurant chain’s parent company, Brinker International, announced last week some outlets were impacted by a data incident, which may have resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of your payment card data. Chili’s, which has more than 1,600 locations worldwide, did not disclose which locations or how many diners might have been affected, but that it believes the data incident was limited to between March – April 2018. The breach involved malware being used to gather payment card information including credit or debit card numbers as well as cardholder names from our payment-related systems for in-restaurant purchases at certain Chili’s restaurants. Company officials also said they are working with third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation to confirm the nature and scope of this incident. The officials said law enforcement authorities have been notified and we are working to provide fraud resolution and credit monitoring services for those whose information may have been obtained through the breach. The company suggests Chili’s customers monitor their bank and credit card statements for accuracy and contact their banks if there is any suspicious activity. Data breaches have been all too common in today’s cybersphere. A series of notable -- and massive -- data breaches occurred last year. Equifax, Uber, the Dallas emergency siren network and state election systems were just a few of the targets of successful hacks. Compromised data included driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and to financial information."
BUSINESS,How Uber Silences Women After Sexual Assaults,"Sophia started using Uber soon after it was founded in 2009. She doesn’t even remember agreeing to, much less reading, the fine print in the app’s terms of service. This would only become important in hindsight. Last December, the 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area native took her final Uber ride. It should’ve been a forgettable 12-minute trip from her company’s holiday party to her home, but it turned into something terrible. When the car pulled up in front of her apartment building, Sophia’s driver asked if he could walk her inside. She said no. Then, just as she was keying in the code to open the front door, he snuck up behind her, pushing her into the foyer. He grabbed her up into a bear hug and groped her. She got away, briefly, fleeing up the stairs to her apartment. He followed. In front of her apartment door, he again squeezed her tightly, putting his hand up her dress. Luckily, she made it inside her apartment and locked him out. Later, after reporting her assault to the police, Sophia learned that her driver was a registered sex offender. How could Uber have allowed this man to drive for the company? she wondered. Sophia, who does not want to publicly reveal her last name, is one of nine women suing Uber for fraud, misleading advertising about its level of safety, and assault, battery and rape. The women are demanding that the ride-sharing company truly reckon with what they say is a widespread sexual assault issue. The details of Sophia’s attack are documented in the lawsuit, where she is identified as Jane Doe #3. The case was filed in 2017 and updated in March when Sophia and six other women joined the suit. The women want Uber to fix what they see as its flawed background check system, the lawsuit says. Because the system is designed to quickly approve drivers, Uber skips steps that would screen out sex offenders like the one who assaulted Sophia, according to the suit. Though Uber has recently announced changes to its system, these women say they’re insufficient. Uber’s terms of service, which, let’s admit, most people don’t read, require all customers to settle disputes -- even over sexual assault and rape -- in arbitration. These are private courtrooms, outside the public justice system, that notoriously favor big companies. Uber defended its use of arbitration in a statement in March when the case expanded, but has since changed its tune somewhat. During a Twitter exchange with Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee who famously shared her story of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he would look at the issue. Sexual assault has no place anywhere and we are committed to doing our part to help end this violence, the company told  in a statement. As we prioritize safety at Uber, we are taking a hard look at these important issues. In arbitration, each woman would have to fight her case alone, on an individual level. The best outcome would be, maybe, a cash settlement. Often, such settlements are kept private through nondisclosure agreements, so other assault victims wouldn’t learn about women who’ve gone through similar experiences. The chances that the company would be forced to re-examine the way it does business are nil. Publicly embarrassed by the letter -- with Khosrowshahi getting called out on Twitter -- the company asked for more time from the court to consider the women’s plea. Uber now has a court-sanctioned deadline of May 17 to formally decide if its sexual assault issues get a public airing out. There are bills at both the federal and state level to stop companies from forcing women into arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would no longer force harassment cases filed by its employees into arbitration. Orrick, a major law firm, made a similar announcement in March."
BUSINESS,How Amazon Is Holding Seattle Hostage,"The committee was taking public comment on the proposed Progressive Tax on Business, a fee on Seattle’s largest corporations to support homeless services. Last week, Amazon — the employer of more than 45,000 Seattleites that is on the hook for an estimated $20 million under the tax — announced it was pausing construction planning on a tower downtown and would consider renting some of its office space to other companies if the fee goes through. Now the mayor and City Council have to decide whether to take this threat seriously. About a third of the attendees at Wednesday’s hearing were wearing construction vests. One of them told committee members that if the tax passes, workers will have to go home, look their kids in the eye and tell them Daddy doesn’t have a job anymore. Another called a member of the City Council a communist (she’s actually a socialist) and said she seems to be getting paid by the residents of Seattle to throw temper tantrums. But the fight is about more than just one company or one policy. It is about the growing challenge of running American cities and all the ways companies make it even harder. Seattle faces an impossible choice: Either raise revenue from employers and risk driving them away, or keep levying taxes on voters and risk a backlash that could exacerbate the very problem it’s trying to solve. Whatever happens here, it will be a template for the rest of the country. The details of Seattle’s proposed tax are crucial to understanding why Amazon hates it so much. Under the current proposal, the city will charge large companies 26 cents for every hour their employees work. That’s about $520 per worker every year. Though the tax will apply only to companies with more than $20 million in revenue per year, or about 3 percent of Seattle businesses, Amazon employs about 145,000 people. And that structure is only temporary. The tax is flat for the first three years: The same fee is levied on wages whether an employee earns $31,200 a year (the minimum wage here) or more than $100,000 (what many Amazon corporate employees make). But in 2021, the flat fee becomes a payroll tax. Large companies will have to pay 0.7 percent of their employees’ wages — that’s $220 per year for minimum wage workers and more than $700 for Amazon’s corporate employees. It’s the second part, bigger taxes for bigger incomes, that seems to worry the companies here. A few days after Amazon’s announcement, the CEO of Seattle-based Zillow made the sametaking-our-ball-and-going-home threat, calling the tax misguided and too blunt of an instrument. But you can’t talk about where the money comes from without talking about where it’s going. Homelessness is an emergency in Seattle. Literally. In 2015, the mayor issued an emergency proclamation over the sheer number of people sleeping outside and in their cars and overflowing from shelters. At last count, Seattle had 11,643 homeless people, and its home of King County had thethird-highest homeless concentration in the nation. A study last year by Zillow estimated that every 5 percent rise in Seattle rents pushed 258 more people into homelessness. Rents here rose 13.5 percent last year alone. The proposed tax would raise about $75 million per year to help address this crisis, bringing the city’s total homelessness budget up to $200 million. Three-quarters of the revenue would go toward building affordable housing and a smaller chunk would go toward direct, immediate services — things like temporary shelters, hygiene centers and shelter beds. Everything the company has said so far has been pretty tepid. Amazon has not, in fact, stopped construction on any downtown towers. It has stopped planning future construction, a much different (and less costly) decision. Similarly, the company announced it was exploring the option of subleasing some floors in one of its already-under-construction office buildings. That doesn’t mean Amazon is crying wolf, but it does mean there’s still a lot of uncertainty about the company’s response. Even if members of the Seattle City Council approve the tax — hell, even if they triple it — Washington is still a relatively cheap place to do business. It has no income tax (which is effectively a pay raise for Amazon employees who move here from elsewhere), no capital gains tax and no corporate income tax. The city even passed an almost identical tax on employees, albeit at a much lower rate, in 2006 before repealing it during the recession. Then there’s the public relations aspect to consider. Though it will grow after 2021, Amazon’s tax bill under the law will be pocket change compared with its $1.6 billion in profits last quarter alone. Moving employees, halting construction and reversing course all have costs, too. Amazon could still pull jobs out of Seattle anyway. The only thing CEO Jeff Bezos loves more than expanding his company is hating taxes. When a handful of states tried passing laws requiring internet retailers to collect sales tax in 2012, his vice president for global public policy called the efforts unconstitutional.  In the past five years, Seattle has seen unprecedented growth, much of it driven by Amazon and other large companies. That has put unbearable strain on the housing market, schools and infrastructure. As the bill for services has grown, the way the city pays for them has become increasingly unjust. Washington has the most regressive tax structure in the country. The poorest 20 percent of residents pay an average of 16.8 percent of their income in state taxes. The richest 1 percent pay just 2.4 percent. This means low-income people are effectively paying for the city’s growth. Alongside the (high and regressive) sales tax, Seattle relies heavily on property taxes. But, thanks to a 2001 ballot initiative, those revenues aren’t allowed to grow by more than 1 percent per year. Everything the city needs (libraries, fire stations, schools) has to be individually approved by voters. Though Seattle’s property taxes are below average compared with other cities, the constant levies and add-ons contribute to a sense among Seattleites that the city is squeezing them for more money every year without keeping up its end of the bargain. And that’s exactly what the Progressive Tax on Business is: a half-measure. No matter what Amazon decides to do, taxing employment, just like taxing cigarette purchases, will result in less of it. And the new tax probably won’t result in a significant reduction in the city’s homeless population. The city estimates the tax will produce 1,780 units of affordable housing, even though its own resolution says it needs more than 17,000."
BUSINESS,Bank Of America Appears To Flip On Firearm Promise With Loan To Remington,"Bank of America has been accused of breaking a promise to stop lending money to companies that sell military-style firearms to civilians after news that the bank agreed to provide critical financing to bankrupt gunmaker Remington. The North Carolina-based bank is among seven financial institutions that have committed to provide Remington, which filed for bankruptcy in March, with an almost $200 million lending package, reported Reuters on Sunday. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Regions Bank each are forking out $43.2 million in loans to help put debt-plagued Remington on stable footing, Reuters said. The gunmaker’s bankruptcy exit plan was recently approved by a Delaware judge.  Terms of the loan agreement were drawn up in late March — a few weeks before Bank of America pledged to stop underwriting or financing businesses that manufacture military-style weapons for civilian use. The bank said it made the promise after intense conversations with its gun-manufacturer clients -- a dialogue prompted by the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Bank of America could legally back out of its agreement to Remington if it wanted to, according to New York Business Journal; it would just have to find other lenders to cover its commitment. The person familiar with Bank of America’s decision pointed out that other financial institutions were reluctant to provide loans to the struggling gunmaker. Reuters reported that 30 potential lenders had refused requests to help Remington in the weeks leading up to the company’s bankruptcy. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently announced that it had created new investment products for clients who are keen to specifically avoid investing in companies that make or sell firearms. Since the Parkland shooting, several financial institutions have moved to distance themselves from the gun industry."
BUSINESS,Ex-Volkswagen CEO Charged In U.S. Over Emissions Cheating Scandal,"Federal prosecutors in Detroit on Thursday unsealed charges against former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to mislead regulators about the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating. indictment filed in secret in March was unsealed in U.S. District Court on the same day as Volkswagen’s annual meeting in Germany. Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015. Winterkorn is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015 by using illicit software that allowed Volkswagen diesel vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. Volkswagen initially suggested that only lower level executives knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn was informed of VW’s diesel emissions cheating in May 2014 and in July 2015 and he agreed with other senior VW executives to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators, prosecutors said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Detroit said Winterkorn was not in custody. In total, nine people have been charged and two have pleaded guilty in the case. One Italian citizen, a former Audi manager, is in Germany awaiting extradition. Six of the former Volkswagen executives charged are in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors because Germany typically does not extradite its citizens."
BUSINESS,"Women Describe Rampant Groping, Sexual Harassment At Verizon-Contracted Warehouse","Several male supervisors at a Verizon-contracted warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee, groped, sexually propositioned and harassed eight current and former female employees, according to charges the women filed last month at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases. One woman says her boss at the fulfillment center, where workers pack and ship Verizon products, came by to offer her a peppermint, dropped it in her hand, then reached down and grabbed her breast. Another woman’s boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague, according to her complaint. After she reported the incident to the human resources department, her boss treated her more harshly, and wrote her up for not working -- falsely, she says in the complaint. She quit in January. Filed in two batches at the EEOC in early and late April, the charges show what pervasive, systemic sexual harassment looks like for low-wage workers of color -- the warehouse workers are primarily African American -- who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of Me Too stories, which tend to focus on high-profile men and more elite, typically white, women. While the first batch of charges got some local press attention, the discrimination claims filed in late April have not been previously reported. On Wednesday, ahead of Verizon’s shareholder meeting, the National Women’s Law Center, a women’s economic rights nonprofit, and four other groups sent a letter to Verizon CEO and chairman Lowell McAdam, urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the Memphis facility. Other signers include the women’s nonprofit A Better Balance, the Tennessee branch of the NAACP and SisterReach, a women’s rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the South. The president of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents actors, singers and other entertainers, also signed on. The letter was addressed to two XPO executives, including in-house lawyer Richard Valitutto. According to the harassment charges, Valitutto was also employed by the warehouse’s previous owners, New Breed Logistics, when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010. The company lost that case, and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues."
BUSINESS,T-Mobile Agrees To Acquire Sprint For $26 Billion,"T-Mobile US Inc agreed on Sunday to acquire peer Sprint Corp, in an all-stock deal for $26 billion that will combine the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers and is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its impact on consumers. The agreement caps four years of on- and off- talks between the companies, setting the stage for the creation of a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No. 2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. U.S. regulators, which have challenged in court AT&T’s $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. The breakthrough in the companies’ negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that will allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books. Under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, regulators have continued to fret about consumer prices. The U.S. government has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month. Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint. Even though Sprint’s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market. T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc. T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans. Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company’s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than Verizon or AT&T’s."
BUSINESS,The SEC Just Made The Case For Divesting From Fossil Fuel Companies Much Stronger,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has waded into the debate over what investors can do to stop fossil fuel companies from destroying the Earth’s habitable climate. And in siding with a major oil company, the agency inadvertently strengthened the case for divesting from fossil fuels altogether. Late last year, Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm that works with environmental groups but also has fossil fuel investments, proposed a shareholder resolution calling for EOG Resources, one of the largest oil producers in the country, to set a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But before shareholders could vote on the proposal, EOG complained to the SEC, requesting approval to ignore the proposal, which it said would micromanage the company with a rigid and time-bound target. In February, the SEC agreed with EOG’s concerns, stating shareholders would not be in a position to make an informed judgment on the matters of a complex nature on which the resolutions sought to act. Last month, the SEC sent a formal letter to Trillium rejecting the proposal, allowing EOG to ignore the resolution and block a vote. Axios’ Amy Harder, who drew national attention to the case earlier this month, called the move unprecedented, leaving investors stunned. The ruling is a major setback for advocates who say internal shareholder pressure from high-minded investors is the best way to reduce pollution by corporate giants. It also adds new weight to arguments calling for more severe government intervention in the energy industry, either by nationalizing utilities and fossil fuel producers or imposing steep levies on emissions and extractive industries. But with Republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government and Democrats largely wrestling over whether to embrace more leftist economic principles, neither of these prospects is likely to happen in the near future. So, at least in the short term, the SEC decision strengthens the case that the only serious strategy for investors to pressure fossil fuel companies is to completely pull their money out. In the year leading up to last February, shareholders filed 429 resolutions, 83 focused on climate change, according to an annual report tracking such proposals. Of that 83 figure, which represents 20 percent of all proposals, 27 resolutions called for carbon risk disclosures and another 27 demanded that companies set deadlines for reducing emissions. Such proposals, even when enacted, do little to incentivize companies to change polluting business practices while providing a veneer of progressive action. Take, for example, Exxon Mobil Corp. The oil giant caved to shareholder pressure last year to thoroughly account for its climate change risks and, in February, issued its first report. But, in a brazen move, the report claimed there is nearly no risk to Exxon Mobil’s business. Shareholder resolutions and shareholder activism pushing fossil fuel companies to change has to take into account what we are really asking for: We need to see real decarbonization plans, Ben Cushing, who helps lead the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, told . That really gets at the core of the fossil fuel industry’s business model. The divestment movement gained significant momentum this year after New York City announced plans in January to pull roughly $5 billion in pension fund investments out of oil, gas and coal companies and sue oil companies for climate change-related damages, a move quickly followed by other cities. European capitals including Berlin, Stockholm and Paris made similar divestments in 2016. "
BUSINESS,Dick's Sporting Goods Is Destroying Its Unsold Assault-Style Rifles,"Dick’s announced in February -- following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida -- that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines in all of its Field & Stream stores, where these items had been sold by the large sports retailer. A company spokeswoman told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last week that the retailer was in the process of destroying the unsold inventory of rifles, which include AR-15s and other military-style semi-automatic weapons, at its four distribution centers nationwide. We are destroying the firearms in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations, the representative said, adding that weapon parts would be sent to a salvage company to be recycled. The National Rifle Association, in a Tuesday Twitter post, lambasted the company’s decision to destroy the weapons. What a waste, the gun group wrote. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates have assailed Dick’s for taking a political stance that could end up hurting its business, with some calling for a boycott of the retailer. But the company’s stock price has remained relatively unchanged since February. Gun companies aren’t obligated to accept merchandise back from a retailer or a wholesaler, but they normally do accept it and reimburse minus a restocking fee of 10 percent to 20 percent, which is what the retailer/wholesaler loses from what he originally paid, said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer who has previously blogged for  as Mike the Gun Guy. Dick’s choice to destroy the assault-style rifles rather than return the firearms to a manufacturer that could redistribute them seems consistent with the company’s efforts to take a principled stance in the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at a high school. Thoughts and prayers are not enough, Dick’s CEO Edward Stack said in February as he announced the company’s decision to end the gun sales. We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens. But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America -- our kids. "
BUSINESS,Facebook Didn’t Seem To Care I Was Being Sexually Harassed Until I Decided To Write About It,"While his genius may be largely uncontested, Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of Facebook is badly adrift from reality. He paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool to bring the world closer together, but in many ways, it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people. As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform. As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform. Zuckerberg’s claim hit a nerve for me as well. Two months ago, a private Facebook group devoted to alt-right Trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me. When alerted to the situation, Facebook’s response On Feb. 13, I awoke to find a stream of friend requests on Facebook and a startling message from a man I did not know: There is some random weirdo posting pictures of you. He sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private Facebook group Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash, which had more than 72,000 members at the time. There I was: standing on the beach in Oahu, wearing shorts, a bikini top and a cardigan. I loved that photo -- it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years. I posted it on Facebook last April. I was stunned as I stared at it almost a year later, along with my full name, literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read: This is going to be a hard one guys. Huffington Post reporter, smash or pass? Immediately, I requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators: Where do you fall on the cuck spectrum? and Are you a normie? I turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible, so I could email them to the appropriate representatives at Facebook. As is common in the publishing industry,  and Facebook work closely on products, partnerships and other shared objectives. It’s difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are. Or to see them casually suggest they’d like to smash, pump and skullfuck you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title. Dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to Facebook. Several hours later, Facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that doesn’t follow our Community Standards. It added: We removed that specific content … instead of the entire group. But subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there. As my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests (now 890 and counting), one of my colleagues wrote a public Facebook post asking others to report the group, hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed. Soon enough, the trolls found her profile, too. With a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe, Facebook’s role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated. It has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its Community Standards (including posts containing nudity, hate speech and violent or graphic content). These users may He vowed that Facebook would have more than 20,000 people working on security and content review across the company by the end of the year, acknowledging that no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.have their content removed or their accounts disabled, or may even be reported to law enforcement. Far from promoting unity, Facebook is an ideal ecosystem for hate groups to flourish. During Zuckerberg’s appearances on the Hill last week, much was made of his site’s explosive growth and transformation, but from my vantage point, staring at screenshots from Emperor Trump’s Dank Meme Stash, Facebook looks remarkably unevolved. A platform that grew out of a hot or not women-ranking site is now a place for users to debate smash or pass."
BUSINESS,"In Los Angeles, Bitter Tensions Over Where To House The Homeless Rile Communities","Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown. El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center. Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question. Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents’ vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They’ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado’s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency. Rosado says Lorena Street isn’t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby. The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted. We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness, said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is that people are on the fence about how we’re going to do that. This concern isn’t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice -- a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts -- have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless. Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals. Five is too many, reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights. The word I would use to describe us was ‘stealth,’ said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF’s director. We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we’ve never done it before. That’s not quite true. Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult. Gallo believes the Rosados’ environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados’ initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk. Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District -- which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger -- was trickling into the barrio. On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER, packed the aisles of City Hall’s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present. The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment. Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar’s about-face. It’s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it’s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that, she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020. On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado’s lawyers, asks for the city’s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review. It also asks for the suspension of the authority of City and City Council... to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project until a full review is conducted."
BUSINESS,The Libertarian Political Movement Is Dead,"When a poor person steals from the rich, Mick Mulvaney calls it a crime. When the rich steal from the poor, he calls it capitalism. On Wednesday, the White House budget director appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to deliver the semiannual report of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which he is also the acting head, and to dispel rumors that he might run to replace Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as speaker of the House. Mick Mulvaney is a busy man. Or maybe not. A day before the hearing, The Associated Press reported that the CFPB has not taken a single enforcement action against any financial institution during the six months Mulvaney has been at the helm. Under his predecessor, Richard Cordray, the agency issued two to four fines and settlements per month. The CFPB has jurisdiction over payday lenders, banks, credit unions and just about any institution involved in extending credit to American families. The apparent improvement in corporate behavior beginning in November struck Democrats on the committee as an extraordinary coincidence. Are you telling me that every single financial institution in America has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law since you took over? demanded an incredulous Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). During other rounds of questioning, Mulvaney emphasized that he is helping the bureau focus on more quantitative analysis in its work and hopes for more guidance from Congress on the meaning of the words abusive, deceptive and material for help in writing and enforcing regulations. It was appropriate for Mulvaney to be defending his record on the day Ryan announced he would not run for re-election in November. Both men began their careers in Washington as leading lights of a younger generation of libertarian-leaning Republicans ferociously opposed to government spending and the regulatory state birthed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. In the name of freedom, capitalism and competition, they hoped to slash programs for the poor and taxes for the rich, singing praises to the rule of law over the rule of men. And yet both politicians have achieved their greatest purpose as agents of Trump, dutifully pressing ahead with narrow priorities while ignoring concerns about every element of their leader’s program that should have frightened small-government advocates -- epic military spending, violent deportations, Russian election-meddling and a soft spot for white nationalism. Their careers illustrate what the libertarian political project in America has become: an unprincipled protection racket for the rich. Ryan delivered them a smashing tax cut, while Mulvaney ensures that garden-variety predation goes uncorrected. Even a congressional oversight hearing for the agency did not really count as oversight. Mulvaney repeatedly insisted that the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB did not require him to answer questions or testify before Congress, only to appear. Hensarling agreed that this was a matter of very grave concern, but the GOP dropped the affair after Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) pointed out the exact same language is used in the Federal Reserve Act to compel the Fed chairman’s regular reports to Congress. And yet, despite the habitually apocalyptic rhetoric from Republicans, it will likely be Democrats who deliver the most serious lasting damage to the CFPB under Trump. In March, the Senate passed a bank deregulation package that would, among other things, help banks hide racial discrimination in the mortgage market, undermine consumer protections for mobile home loans and eliminate a host of predatory lending standards for smaller banks. The bill was crafted by Senate Republicans and four Democrats -- Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who distributed a breathtakingly dishonest Myth vs. Fact sheet to drum up support. Ultimately, 17 Democrats voted for the bill, including the party’s 2016 vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Unless the Republican-controlled House completely loses its collective mind, the bill will be signed into law by President Trump."
BUSINESS,Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Ditches Facebook After Data Scandal,"Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak is ditching Facebook. Users provide every detail of their life to Facebook and ... Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this, Wozniak told USA Today via email. The profits are all based on the user’s info, but the users get none of the profits back. He also told the newspaper that he had deactivated his account, but did not delete it to keep control over his SteveWoz screen name. I don’t want someone else grabbing it, even another Steve Wozniak, he said. It’s brought me more negatives than positives, he wrote. Wozniak is the latest public figure to ditch the social network after a whistleblower revealed that the personal data of millions of users had been improperly shared with a third party. Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk not only quit Facebook, he also pulled the pages for Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity. We must encourage more oversight by the owners of these social media platforms, Carrey told CNBC in February, saying he was also dumping his stock in the company. This easy access has to be more responsibly handled. What we need now are activist investors to send a message that responsible oversight is needed. What the world needs now is capitalism with a conscience."
BUSINESS,Twitter Has Suspended 1.2 Million Accounts For 'Terrorist Content',"Twitter announced Thursday that it has suspended more than 1.2 million accounts since August 2015 to the end of 2017 for terrorist content. In the latest six-month reporting period, ending Dec. 31, Twitter permanently suspended 274,460 accounts for violations related to the promotion of terrorism, the company revealed in a blog post detailing highlights from its 12th biannual Twitter Transparency Report. Last year, relatives of victims of the 2015 San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack that killed 14 people filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Google and Facebook, accusing the tech giants of supporting Islamic State. The suit claims the companies allowed Islamic State to build an outsized online presence to draw recruits. Twitter’s latest suspension count was down 8.4 percent from 299,649 suspensions in the previous six-month reporting period and down 27 percent from the last half of 2016. Of the blocked accounts in the latest period, 93 percent were spotted by internal company tracking tools and 74 percent were cut before the first tweet appeared, Twitter reported. Government reports of violations related to terrorism represented less than 0.2 percent — 597 accounts — of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period, according to Twitter. A far larger number of Twitter accounts were reported by government agencies (including police departments) for abusive behavior — including hate speech, racism, sexism and other types of trolling, which Twitter has been harshly criticized for failing to police. Government agencies reported 6,254 Twitter accounts in the last half of 2017 for abusive behavior, but the company took action against only a quarter of those accounts. Abusive content continues to be a particular problem for Twitter overseas, where laws more sharply restrict hate speech and trolling. A new European Commission regulation last month called on social media platforms to remove illegal content within an hour of it being reported. "
BUSINESS,Trump Proposes Slapping $100 Billion In New Tariffs On Chinese Goods,"China warned on Friday it would fight back at any cost with fresh trade measures if the United States continues on its path of protectionism, hours after President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods. We’ve already lost the trade war. We don’t have a trade war, we’ve lost the trade war, Trumpsaid in a radio interview with New York radio show, 77 WABC’s Bernie & Sid early on Friday. In a Twitter message on Wednesday, he had said: That war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. In light of China’s unfair retaliation against earlier U.S. trade actions, Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a high stakes tit-for-tat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world’s two biggest economies. While China has projected an image of multilateralism and restraint amid the escalating trade dispute with the United States, Beijing has been swift to respond to Washington’s rhetoric and actions. So far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737. It also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in-South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China. A (full-blown) trade war meanwhile would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and Chinawould suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth – a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point, and cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford’s baseline scenario. The escalating tit-for-tat trade actions between the two economic superpowers have roiled global financial markets, as investors worried about the impact on world trade and growth, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end, Shay added in a statement, urging Trump to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy. This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start, said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay."
BUSINESS,The Facebook Apology Tour Continues,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know he’s super sorry. And for the most part it really does seem like he means it -- so long as apologizing and trying to earn back users’ trust doesn’t cut into company profits. On Wednesday afternoon, the social media company made its founder available for questions from the media shortly after it announced plans to restrict who can access user data and to clarify how it uses that data in the first place. At the same time, Facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm Cambridge Analytica, from 50 million to as many as 87 million. Zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of Russia’s misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow. There is going to be more content that we’re going to find over time, he said. As long as there are people employed in Russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems, this is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security; it’s an arms race. He acknowledged Facebook was behind during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20,000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts. There hasn’t been any meaningful impact by the movement, he said, but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment that’s driving it. Even if we can’t measure a change, it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust.  Facebook took Cambridge Analytica at its word that the company had, in fact, deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users -- and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted. Zuckerberg didn’t rule out the possibility of legal action against Cambridge Analytica but said Facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when. I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility, Zuckerberg said. We’re not just building tools, but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well. He’s into it, with some reservations. Asked specifically if he’d be willing to implement new privacy policies in the U.S. similar to the strict new privacy laws rolling out in the European Union, Zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format. When the EU law takes effect on May 25, Facebook will have to get users’ explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data. Zuckerberg said Facebook intends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe. That’s subject to some flexibility, however -- a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter. When you’re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up. And if we’d gotten this right, we would’ve messed something else up. I don’t think anyone is going to be perfect. But I think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is. Nope. Zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question, portraying a more profitable Facebook as one that’s fundamentally more useful to people. As the site gets better at targeting users with more-relevant ads, the more profitable it will be. People tell us that if they’re going to see ads, they want the ads to be good. Like most of the hard decisions we have to make, this is one where there’s a trade-off between values that people care about. On the one hand, people want relevant experiences, and on the other hand, I do think there’s some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads. But I think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience. The first category of bad actors he summed up as spammers who craft sensationalistic fake stories. People click, the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author -- often located in Macedonia -- makes money. Simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content. The second category belongs to Russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election. Zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat -- especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion. Facebook is making progress here, with moderate successes in the French and German elections, but Zuckerberg cautioned it will be a multi-year effort. And the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself. That shows up on Facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that isn’t really true even if the specific facts might be. Zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting broadly trusted journalism that does a fair and thorough job."
BUSINESS,"Saks, Lord & Taylor Hit By Payment Card Data Breach","Retailer Hudson’s Bay Co on Sunday disclosed that it was the victim of a security breach that compromised data on payment cards used at Saks and Lord & Taylor stores in North America. One cyber security firm said that it has evidence that millions of cards may have been compromised, which would make the breach one of the largest involving payment cards over the past year, but added that it was too soon to confirm whether that was the case. Toronto-based Hudson’s Bay said in a statement that it had taken steps to contain the breach but did not say it had succeeded in confirming that its network was secure. It also did not say when the breach had begun or how many payment card numbers were taken. Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring, the statement said. The breach comes as Hudson’s Bay struggles to improve its financial performance as a tough retail environment has weighed on sales and margins. Last June, it launched a transformation plan to cut costs and is working to monetize the value of its substantial real estate holdings. Hudson’s Bay disclosed the incident after New York-based cyber security firm Gemini Advisory reported on its blog that Saks and Lord & Taylor had been hacked by a well-known criminal group known as JokerStash. JokerStash, which sells stolen data on the criminal underground, on Wednesday said that it planned to release more than 5 million stolen credit cards, according to Gemini Chief Technology Officer Dmitry Chorine. Alex Holden, chief information security officer with cyber security firm Hold Security, confirmed that the 125,000 cards had been released by JokerStash but said it was too soon to estimate how many had been taken from Hudson’s Bay. If in fact millions of records were stolen, the breach would be one of the largest involving payment cards in the past year, but it would still be far smaller than any of the biggest thefts on record, which occurred a decade ago. Hackers stole more than 130 million credit cards from credit-card processor Heartland Payment Systems, convenience store operator 7-Eleven Inc and grocer Hannaford Brothers Co, from 2006 to 2008, according to U.S. federal investigators."
BUSINESS,International Health Group Drops Partnership With Heineken Over 'Beer Girls',"An international health organization has suspended its partnership with the Heineken beer company because of the controversial use of so-called beer girls to promote its products. The Global Fund launched a partnership in January with the Dutch brewer in its latest campaign to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Heineken was to use its communications and logistics expertise to help shape effective messages, identify demand and provide quality control in shipments of medical supplies, according to a Heineken statement. We take these allegations very seriously and have challenged Heineken to examine their operations and make changes to protect women from sexual exploitation and health risks, said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands. We are suspending the partnership until such time as Heineken can take appropriate action to address these issues.  The mostly young drink promoters are paid low wages — and work for tips, largely from groups of intoxicated men — to push certain beers in bars. Heineken has come under particular pressure to end the practice in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. A 2011 study found that some Heineken beer girls in Cambodian bars moonlighted as sex workers for extra money and faced increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The practices described go completely against what we stand for as a company, and therefore we strongly condemn these malpractices, said the Heineken statement. The beer promoters are not employed by Heineken, but are sourced via external agencies ... this makes it difficult to properly supervise the working conditions. However, we simply cannot allow them to continue to be confronted with unwanted intimacies and abuse or even with prostitution during their work. It’s been a bad month for Heineken. Earlier this week, the company yanked a beer commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as terribly racist. The Heineken Light ad showed a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past several black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline, Sometimes, lighter is better, flashed on the screen. The Global Fund is an international organization headquartered in Geneva that’s the largest funder of programs to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided seed money for the organization that began in 2002, according to Agence France Presse."
BUSINESS,"MyFitnessPal Security Breach Affects 150 Million Users, Under Armour Reports","Hackers breached MyFitnessPal, a popular calorie-counting app and website, and acquired private data from about 150 million users. Under Armour Inc., which owns the nutritional app, announced Thursday that an unauthorized party gained access to the data in late February. Information acquired by the hackers included user names, email addresses and hashed passwords, the company said.  Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers were not affected since the app doesn’t collect that information. Payment card information was also unaffected because the company collects and processes that information separately. We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation, Fipps wrote. We have also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement authorities. Under Armour is the latest victim of a string of security breaches affecting companies in all industries. Orbitz, a travel booking site, announced this month that it had a security breach that affected about 880,000 payment cards from the site’s users. Equifax also announced this month that it had another massive data breach affecting 2.4 million customers in 2017, six months after it revealed a previous breach that affected 143 million additional people. Other major organizations to face widespread security breaches in recent years include Yahoo, Uber and the Pentagon."
BUSINESS,These Stock Photos Show Masculinity Is More Than Biceps And Beer,"Stock photography is synonymous with outdated and ridiculous gender stereotypes. There’s women laughing alone with salad -- a viral meme that has morphed into women laughing alone with tablets -- and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks. The models in all these examples are usually white and extremely heteronormative. But stock photo companies are increasingly trying to reflect our current culture. In the past few years, Getty, Adobe and Shutterstock have all tried to break away from the clichés they’re known for reinforcing, especially as a new crop of stockphoto startups focus exclusively on diverse images. Giants like Getty started with tackling female stereotypes, teaming up with Sheryl Sandberg in 2014 to create the Lean In collection, which shows women working in labs and hiking, no romaine lettuce in sight. Now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of Masculinity Undone. Getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting, hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows. We’re trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side, Guy Merrill, Getty’s global head of art, told . We’re breaking away from stereotypes: the business leader, the absent father and buffoon … the lonely guy who doesn’t need any friends or community. The shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to be a man. There’s been a backlash against the type of aggressive, authoritative manliness embodied by President Donald Trump and white nationalists, along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates. Today’s hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor -- think Timothée Chalamet and Harry Styles. Jay-Z talks openly about being in therapy, Jaden Smith wears dresses, and in every episode of Queer Eye, the Netflix makeover series, a man breaks down in tears. Stock photo companies say data, client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity. In the past few years, Getty searches for man meditation went up by 126 percent, man looking worried by 100 percent and gay dads by 53 percent, according to the company. A recent Shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of U.S. marketers think it’s important to use images that reflect modern day society. Stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images. Getty and Shutterstock both have more than 200,000 contributors, ranging from iPhone amateurs to professionals, who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed. While companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want -- more men sitting in half lotus, please -- once contributors have been accepted onto the platform, they can upload whatever images they choose, so long as they aren’t offensive or illegal. Getty’s Lean In collection, for example, represents just 0.01 percent of the company’s more than 190 million images. If someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad, despite all the memes, we can’t stop them, said Merrill, though he noted that Getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on Masculinity Undone-themed shoots. Stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos. In 2007, Getty’s top-selling image for the search term woman was a half-naked woman lying on a bed. Now it’s a woman hiking a rocky trail. But Aiello said that doesn’t necessarily equal progress. She has found that photos from the Lean In collection most often appeared in lightweight lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination. It’s not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want -- we also want to re-picture clichés for them, he said. This is where we need to be in a year or two. Our customers might not be there yet, but we know they are going to be. And we want to make sure they have the pictures and the imagery when that happens. "
BUSINESS,Trapped Inside The Monster Energy Frat House,"A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture. The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an evening nightcap in his hotel room on work trips, she told . Robert Duck, Simmons’ direct boss who works out of Monster’s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook’s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said. He said Ted was harmless, ‘a dirty old man,’ Simmons recalled. Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by , he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message. Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn’t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few monthsafter receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind, the company said in January. Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false. We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices, Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent. Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company, the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after  published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Through a spokesman, Monster also told  that Simmons’ account was not accurate. Simmons’ last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote: Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this. Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called Assault. A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick."
BUSINESS,There Are Psychological Reasons Parents Are So Obsessed With Target,"It’s no secret that parents, particularly moms, love to love Target. They write rhapsodizing blog posts, create fan Instagram accounts, draw comics and tweet endlessly about their Target obsessions. At least one mom chose to take her maternity photos at a Target store, and another even gave birth to her child in one (albeit unintentionally). I never thought dashing to Target without kids would feel like a mini-vacation, but it does. And sometimes that’s all a mom of little kids needs to recharge, mom and blogger Jennifer S. White told . Indeed, many parents find that Target offers them an opportunity to escape the chaos and stress at home without feeling guilty … because, after all, they’re running errands and buying necessities (and some non-necessities, too) for their families. Target is close by and a more socially acceptable place for parents to sneak away to solo than, say, a bar, said mom and blogger Samantha Taylor, who also told  she sees solo Target trips as mini-vacations. Jennifer Cutler, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, believes Target offers a sense of whimsical escapism that particularly appeals to parents. Part of its brand is trying to make the shopping experience a treat. One thing that parents have in common is a shortage of time. Being able to reframe the drudgery of running errands as whimsical escapism is really powerful, she told , pointing out the colorful -- and even magical -- imagery in the brand’s marketing materials. Target is so addictive because it has everything you need: from batteries, to groceries, to cat litter. And it has a bunch of stuff you don’t need but really want when you see it, like super-cute earrings for you and cheap, adorable outfit separates for your kids, Taylor explained. We feel guilty about going on a frivolous shopping binge but not about throwing a $5 pair of clearance earrings in with the cleaning supplies inside our cart. You walk into Target, and the lighting, the colors, even the smell really capture you because it feels great, said Yiu. It’s like it increases the dopamine in the brain. You see that everything is really well-organized and even color-coded. As a mom, my home doesn’t look like that. So you walk in and think, ‘This is really great.’ The look and feel of Target stores appeal to consumers’ different senses -- from the sound of upbeat music to the scent of coffee and popcorn. Rima Touré-Tillery, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School who studies the intersection of motivation and self-perception in marketing, said the inviting appearance of Target relates to the brand’s colors: red and white. Brands aren’t stupid. They’re studying this, and the retail environment they’re trying to create is to maximize the experience, the memories, the emotion, said the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed, noting that there are design principles meant to pique shoppers’ curiosity and guide them through the store. I prefer to shop Target alone as a sort of pathetic mini-vacation, but if I bring my kids, I like to keep them strapped in to the baby seat whenever possible, Taylor told . Usually I’ll reward them with a trip to the toy aisle, just to look, if they behave. White told  she supports the company’s attention to many issues that matter to parents. Target has done an incredible job attempting to stay on top of current parental concerns, like clothing and gender, and making the store accessible for families with special needs."
BUSINESS,Walmart Partners With Conservative Group To Remove Cosmo From Checkout Lines,"Customers at some 5,000 Walmart locations around the United States will no longer see Cosmopolitan magazine among the publications for purchase in the check-out line. That’s because the retail giant decided to remove the magazine so customers would not be exposed to its sexually exploitative content, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation said in a press release on Tuesday. This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture, and NCOSE is proud to work with a major corporation like Walmart to combat sexually exploitative influences in our society, said NCOSE executive director Dawn Hawkins. We are grateful for Walmart’s cooperation and for Walmart leadership’s recognition that corporations must do their part to change #MeToo culture, Hawkins added. I’m embarrassed for Hawkins because she just broadcasted to the entire country that she is a woman who has no idea what #MeToo means. ICYMI: #MeToo is about unwanted sex and sexual attention, sexual assault, and harassment. While Cosmopolitan is a magazine and a brand best known for its sex tips (including my personal favorite, a suggestion to ring a donut on a guy’s penis)—it is all about consensual adult sex. Cosmopolitan is the most successful global media brand for young women, with award-winning content produced by leading female journalists. With our focus on empowerment, we are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues."
BUSINESS,"Uber Halts Self-Driving Car Tests In California, Where It Didn't Test Much Anyway","Uber will not renew its permit to test self-driving cars in California, a decision the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles discussed in a letter to the company on Tuesday. The permit is set to expire March 31, but Uber indefinitely halted its autonomous vehicle testing nationwide following a fatal crash last Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona. The collision killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she walked her bike across a road, and was the first fatal crash between an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian. Should Uber want to begin testing in California again, the company will need to re-apply for a permit, a process that will require it to provide a thorough explanation of the crash in Arizona, Soublet wrote in his letter. Prior to resuming autonomous vehicle testing operations in California, Uber must apply for a new autonomous vehicle testing permit he added. Any application for a new permit will need to address any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona and may also require a meeting with the department. Uber was already on thin ice with California regulators. In 2016, the state gave Uber’s self-driving cars the boot after the company refused to get government approval to test there. Instead of applying for the $150 permits, Uber shipped its autonomous Volvo SUVs to Arizona, where regulations are more relaxed."
BUSINESS,Remington Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Amid Mounting Pressure For More Gun Control,"Remington Outdoor Co Inc., one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday to carry out a debt-cutting deal with creditors amid mounting public pressure for greater gun control. The company listed assets in the range of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities in the range of $500 million to $1 billion. Remington, America’s oldest gun maker, announced the deal in February to reduce its $950 million debtload in a deal that will transfer control of the company to creditors. In some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, protesters called on lawmakers and President Donald Trump to confront the issue. Voter registration activists fanned out in the crowds, signing up thousands of the nation’s newest voters. Citi also said it was restricting sales for buyers under 21, a move adopted by other large retailers, while Kroger Co’s superstore chain Fred Meyer said it will stop selling firearms entirely. Remington and other gunmakers have suffered from slumping sales in the past year as fears of stricter gun laws have faded. Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware."
BUSINESS,"Elon Musk's Estranged Father Has Child With Stepdaughter, Says It's 'God's Plan'","The elder Musk told The Sunday Times of London this weekend that he fathered a son with 30-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout, the daughter of his former wife Heide. Jana -- who is Elon’s younger stepsister -- was 4 years old when her mother wed Errol, a union that lasted 18 years before the pair got divorced. Errol, 72, told the publication that he did not look on Jana as his stepdaughter because she lived away from the family for the majority of her childhood. He also said they reconnected more recently after Jana had gone through a breakup. Another of Errol’s children, his daughter Alexandra Ali Musk (pictured below on a happier occasion), was apparently also upset at the news. Errol told The Daily Mail that when he informed his family that the baby was his, he thought [Ali] would be supportive and understanding. Instead, Errol said that Ali called him insane, mentally ill and that now his family believes he’s getting senile and should go into an old age home, not have a life full of fun and a tiny baby. "
BUSINESS,YouTube Quietly Escalates Crackdown On Firearm Videos,"YouTube is tightening restrictions on videos featuring firearms and accessories, entering the intensifying gun control debate. The move, announced this week, has already been condemned by some firearm enthusiasts as overreaching censorship. Others applauded the company -- the world’s largest video platform -- for taking a stand in the wake of last month’s Parkland, Florida, high school massacre. Under the new rules, to be enforced starting in April, YouTube will prohibit videos that link to sites selling firearms or gun accessories. Instructional videos containing information about how to build guns also will be restricted. YouTube in October began removing videos showing how to modify firearms with bump stocks following the massacre in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds injured. The shooter used the gun attachment on his rifles, allowing him to fire much more quickly. YouTube posted its policy change less than a week before March For Our Lives, a gun control rally organized by survivors of the Parkland massacre. More than a half-million people are expected to attend the protest Saturday in Washington and in other cities."
BUSINESS,Dow Plunges Amid Wall Street Fears About Trade War,"U.S. stocks slumped on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s move to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports drove fears about the impact on the global economy, fueling the biggest percentage declines in Wall Street’s three major indexes since they entered correction territory six weeks ago. Trump signed a presidential memorandum that will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period. China will have space to respond, reducing the risk of immediate retaliation from Beijing. But after equities recovered somewhat from earlier lows, selling pressure resumed on Wall Streetheading into the close as investors fretted over the potential scale of U.S tariffs and possible impact on global trade. Major industrials slumped. Plane maker Boeing Co lost 5.2 percent, Caterpillar Inc dropped 5.7 and 3M Co lost 4.7. The three were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P industrials sector plunged 3.28 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 724.42 points, or 2.93 percent, to 23,957.89, the S&P 500 lost 68.24 points, or 2.52 percent, to 2,643.69, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 178.61 points, or 2.43 percent, to 7,166.68. The losses marked the biggest daily percentage drop for each of the major indexes since Feb. 8, when the Dow and S&P confirmed a market correction from their Jan. 26 highs. Selling was broad, with only the defensive utilities 0.44on the plus side, up 0.44 percent, out of 11 major S&P sectors. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&P 500, finished up 5.48 points at 23.34, its highest close since Feb. 13.23.34 Another decline in shares of Facebook Inc, down 2.7 percent, continued to weigh on the broader market and the tech sector, the best performing S&P group for this year. The S&P technology index fell 2.69 percent on fears of greater regulation in the wake of the Facebook data leak. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners."
BUSINESS,"Toys R Us Founder Charles Lazarus, 94, Dies As His Empire Comes To A Close","Charles Lazarus, the 94-year-old founder of Toys R Us, died Thursday, about a week after the company announced it would file liquidation papers and likely close all of its U.S. operations. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September. In a tweet, the company announced Lazarus’ death, saying there had been many sad moments recently but none more upsetting than the death of its founder. Lazarus founded Toys R Us in June 1957, nine years after he opened his first baby furniture and toy store in Washington, D.C., called Children’s Bargain Town. After nearly a decade running Children’s Bargain Town, Lazarus restructured his business, decided to focus solely on toys and reformatted the store to take after a supermarket, so customers could see open shelves of toys and place desired items in shopping carts. In the ’80s, Toys R Us went international, opening locations all over the world. During the company’s closing announcement last week, administrators for the retailer said it planned to close all 75 stores in the U.K. The widespread shutdowns will affect roughly 3,000 employees in the U.K., and about 31,000 in the U.S. There are 791 remaining Toys R Us locations in America. The company had about $5 billion in long-term debt when it filed for bankruptcy in September. When Toys R Us first entered Chapter 11, it had an ambitious plan to restructure and reemerge a healthy business. But after a weak holiday season performance coupled with intense competition from rivals including Amazon, Target and Walmart seemed to do the company in, according to USA Today. In a statement to , a Toys R Us spokesperson reiterated the sadness the company felt after Lazarus’ death, adding, He visited us in New Jersey just last year and we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere."
BUSINESS,Mark Zuckerberg Addresses Cambridge Analytica Incident As Facebook Fumbles,"After a riotous week full of revelations that Facebook enabled a shadowy British firm called Cambridge Analytica to harvest and exploit the personal information of more than 50 million users -- then failed to follow up on it for more than two years -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered an off-camera act of contrition Wednesday, yet no apology. In the missive, Zuckerburg acknowledged there’s been a breach of trust between Facebook and its users. He outlined several steps he hopes will restore public trust in the company, all aimed at clarifying and restricting which apps have access to which types of data. Facebook also said it will investigate the apps on the platform that had access to large amounts of user data prior to 2014, before the company began limiting developers’ access. It plans to ban those found to be in violation of Facebook’s terms and notify affected users, including those affected by Cambridge Analytica. We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you, wrote Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to appear in an interview on CNN Wednesday night. Zuckerberg also failed to clarify how, exactly, Cambridge Analytica held onto and kept using the harvested data for a full two years after Facebook learned Cambridge had acquired it. He does offer the feeble defense that Facebook asked for, and received, a formal certification from the company verifying it deleted the data, but it was clearly insufficient. In a separate post, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg went a step further, stating she deeply regrets how Facebook handled Cambridge Analytica -- but again, it’s no apology. You deserve to have your information protected -- and we’ll keep working to make sure you feel safe on Facebook, she wrote. Your trust is at the core of our service. We know that and we will work to earn it. Both were absent from an internal briefing about the situation Tuesday (though they were never scheduled to appear in the first place). And while Zuckerberg was expected to speak at an all-hands meeting Friday, it seems that’s been bumped up a day or two. Not like last time, in September, when he appeared before cameras andpledged Facebook would do a better job self-regulating and create a new standard for transparency in online political ads. Or the time before that, in July 2017, when a Facebook spokesperson flat-out told CNN we have seen no evidence that Russian actors bought ads on Facebook in connection with the election. (Then-President Barack Obama reportedly pulled Zuckerberg aside a couple of days after he made the statement and warned he should take the threat of disinformation on the network seriously. About a year after Obama’s warning, Zuckerberg wrote a mea culpa saying he regretted the statement. This is too important an issue to be dismissive, he said.) Or the time before that, during the first Democratic primary of 2016, when Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor, said he warned Zuckerberg and Sandberg that people were being manipulated on the platform -- yet his concerns went unheeded. They treated it like a public relations problem, rather than a substantive issue for the business, he said, in a statement that’s just as relevant today as it was then. Facebook has forcefully argued it’s fine policing itself since at least 2011, when the Federal Election Commission first considered regulating political ads on the platform, then backed down after being warned by company lawyers not to stand in the way of innovation. Making you angry, making you afraid, is really good for Facebook’s business, McNamee said previously. It is not good for America. It’s not good for the users of Facebook."
BUSINESS,Weinstein Company Files For Bankruptcy After Sale Talks Collapse,"U.S. film and TV studio The Weinstein Company, whose ex-Chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault, said on Monday it filed for bankruptcy and was ending all non-disclosure agreements that may have silenced some women. The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in the Delaware court, listing $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities and $500 million to $1 billion in assets, and said it struck a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets. The bankruptcy comes after the studio spent months looking for a buyer or investor. The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company’s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction. More than 70 women accused the company’s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood’s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. In February, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. Bob Weinstein co-founded the company and is the co-chairman. This is a watershed moment for efforts to address the corrosive effects of sexual misconduct in the workplace, Schneiderman said in a statement after the company’s announcement on Monday. Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including The King’s Speech and Silver Linings Playbook, as well as TV series such as long-running fashion reality competition Project Runway."
BUSINESS,45 U.S. Trade Groups Beg Trump: Don't Impose Tariffs On China,"Forty-five U.S. trade associations representing some of the largest companies in the country are urging President Donald Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be particularly harmful to the U.S. economy and consumers. The organizations said in a letter sent to Trump on Sunday that potential tariffs on China would raise prices on consumer goods, kill jobs and drive down financial markets. The letter marks the latest in a growing rift between Trump and the business community on trade policies, as the president has begun to take more aggressive steps he says are needed to protect domestic industry. We urge the administration not to impose tariffs and to work with the business community to find an effective, but measured, solution to China’s protectionist trade policies and practices that protects American jobs and competitiveness, the groups wrote. The groups called on Trump to work with trade allies to push for changes to China’s policies. The business groups said while they had serious concerns about China’s approach to trade, unilateral tariffs by the United States would only separate the country from allies, and encourage them to replace the U.S. business presence in China when Beijing retaliates. The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing’s intellectual property and investment practices. The Republican president recently announced plans to impose tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports, despite opposition from some business sectors. We urge the administration to take measured, commercially meaningful actions consistent with international obligations that benefit U.S. exporters, importers, and investors, rather than penalize the American consumer and jeopardize recent gains in American competitiveness, they said. The groups also called on Trump to allow industry experts to comment on the economic impact of any changes in trade policy before the measures take effect."
BUSINESS,Claire's Is Entering A New Chapter In Life: Bankruptcy,"First Toys R Us, and now Claire’s. Mainstay institutions within malls across America are entering a new chapter in life: bankruptcy. Cheap jewelry giant Claire’s filed for Chapter 11 on Monday, hoping to rid itself of substantial debt, the company announced. Claire’s maintained that it was approaching the bankruptcy filing from a position of strength, using Chapter 11 to restructure its budget sheet, not its operations. So jewelry fans and ear-piercing enthusiasts, fear not! Claire’s plans to continue its store operations per usual throughout the Chapter 11 process. And the U.S. bankruptcy filing pertains only to Claire’s stores in America, not the company’s international subsidiaries. Still, Claire’s, which says it’s pierced over 100 million ears worldwide, plans to close some underperforming stores and renegotiate leases, according to The New York Times. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2018 with $1.9 billion less in debt. While mall traffic has been declining over the years with the rise of online shopping, Claire’s says its beloved ear-piercing service is internet-proof since it cannot be replicated on the web. The company says it pierced 3.5 million ears in the U.S. last year. News of Claire’s Chapter 11 filing comes on the heels of reports that fellow mall tenant Toys R Us may close all of its operations in America, which could affect roughly 33,000 U.S. workers. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September."

BUSINESS,iHeartMedia Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection,"IHeartMedia Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday as the largest U.S. radio station owner reached an in-principle agreement with creditors to restructure its overwhelming debt load. The company, which filed for bankruptcy along with some of its units, said it ‍reached the agreement with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt for a balance sheet restructuring, which would reduce its debt by more than $10 billion. IHeartMedia, which has struggled with $20 billion of debt and falling revenue at its 858 radio stations, said cash on hand and cash generated from ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund the business during the bankruptcy process. The agreement ... is a significant accomplishment, as it allows us to definitively address the more than $20 billion in debt that has burdened our capital structure, Chief Executive Bob Pittman said. The filing comes after John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion, uniting the company with Liberty’s Sirius XM Holdings Inc satellite radio service. IHeartMedia skipped a $106 million interest payment on Feb. 1, triggering a 30-day grace period during which the company has tried to hammer out a deal with it bondholders. The company disclosed on Monday it was still exchanging proposals with its creditors, but had yet to reach an agreement. Its most recent proposal would have given holders of secured loans, who are owed nearly $13 billion, about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia. These creditors also would have received iHeartMedia’s 89.5 percent stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. The private equity firms led a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc in 2008, just as the buyout boom was fading and as the signs of the financial crisis began to emerge. Shares of iHeartMedia lost three-quarters of their value in the second half of 2015 and have never recovered since then. On Monday, the pink sheet stock closed at 48 cents. IHeartMedia traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered.

The company had 14,300 employees at the end of 2016, according to its most recent annual report."
BUSINESS,"Toys R Us May Shut Down All U.S. Operations, Impacting Thousands Of Workers","Toys R Us, an iconic U.S. retailer of children’s toys, has announced plans to file liquidation papers and likely close most if not all of its remaining stores, potentially impacting up to 33,000 U.S. workers. In a conference call with staff on Wednesday, reported on by The Wall Street Journal, CEO David Brandon said the company would file the papers ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing Thursday. The CEO blamed the liquidation on a number of factors, including vendors who didn’t support the company during the crucial holiday season and customers who choose to shop elsewhere. A representative for Toys R Us on Wednesday confirmed the Journal’s report and noted that there would not be an immediate shut down. The big box retailer, which has some 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores around the world, filed for bankruptcy in September over $5 billion in long-term debt. The company said the debt had prevented it from investing to compete in what it called an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide. The toy chain is already in the process of closing down about 180 of its more than 800 U.S. stores. A CNBC report Wednesday cited people familiar with the situation who said the retailer was working on a proposal to keep about 200 stores open even after the liquidation. The plan may include selling the company’s Canadian operations, along with roughly 200 of the company’s most profitable U.S. stores, to a new buyer, according to CNBC."
BUSINESS,Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Charged With 'Massive Fraud' By SEC,"In a complaint filed Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission leveled charges of massive fraud against Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of the Silicon Valley startup Theranos -- charges Holmes has agreed to settle. The SEC also named former Theranos President Ramesh Sunny Balwani in its complaint, accusing Holmes and Balwani of raising over $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance. The privately held startup had promised to revolutionize the blood testing industry, claiming its proprietary technology could run more than 240 tests on a single drop of blood. Fueled by that claim, and by an early (and ultimately doomed) partnership with Walgreens, Theranos hit a valuation of around $9 billion in 2014. But by 2016, as news began to spread that Theranos’ technology might not be up to snuff, the company’s value tanked, wiping out Holmes’ $4.5 billion net worth with it. Wednesday’s SEC complaint asserts that the company’s claims about its technological abilities were misrepresentations at best and outright lies at worst. For instance, Theranos claimed the U.S. Department of Defense deployed its portable blood analyzers to Afghanistan for use aboard medevac helicopters, generating $100 million in revenue in 2014. Not only did the DOD never do such a thing, but Theranos’ 2014 revenues were actually closer to $100,000. The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley, Jina Choi, director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office, said in a release. Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday. As part of the settlement, Holmes has agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty and relinquish 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock and her voting control in the company. She’s also been barred from serving as a director of a public company for 10 years."
BUSINESS,Facebook Defends Its Use Of Secret Courts To Handle Sexual Harassment Cases,"Facebook isn’t typically shy about proclaiming its support for women. After all, chief operating officer and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg built her brand on feminism. Last year, the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment. But on one critical policy, Facebook is awfully wishy-washy: forced arbitration. Facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes, like discrimination or wage claims, to private courtrooms. The process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement. In a series of conversations with  over the past few weeks, Facebook representatives took part in a strange dance: They defended the company’s use of forced arbitration, but also said Facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases. Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, put arbitration back in the headlines this month, after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump. The arbitration process Facebook uses is very official and appropriate, a spokeswoman told . She pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration, it doesn’t require that participants keep silent, as other employers often do. ( could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company.) Arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private, she said. She also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice, pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use. In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours after  published this story, the company’s head of employment law, Heidi Swartz, wrote, Facebook does not use ‘secret courts’ to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by . That claim is false and misleading. We have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration. If the past year or so has taught us anything, it’s that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders don’t catch every bad actor. Opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. The easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that ‘this could never happen here,’ Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a December blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration. While it’s natural to hope and believe that’s the case, one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that people’s voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed. (Microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee.) Microsoft is the one major tech company that’s thrown its support behind the the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) in December, would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration. Instead, employees would have a choice in the matter, giving them more leverage in going up against a deep-pocketed corporation. I’m glad Facebook says they feel they’re taking harassment seriously, but I had hope that they’d actually Lean In and lead by example on this, Bustos told , using Sandberg’s book title to make her point. All businesses need to take a look at this issue. Time’s up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug, she said. About 60.1 million workers in the U.S. are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Many of them have no idea; you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook. Former Facebook engineer Chia Hong sued Facebook for sexual harassment and discrimination in 2015. Hong alleged she was frequently ignored and belittled in meetings where she was sometimes the only woman, was admonished for taking a personal day each month to volunteer at her kid’s school, and was ordered to serve drinks to male colleagues. Bustos has been tweeting at House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) every day this month, asking him to bring the bill to a vote. This is in his hands. He could make a decision or he could take the side of sexual harassers, she said. Also on International Women’s Day, Sandberg wrote a passionate Facebook tribute to women. I’m more dedicated than ever to creating a more equal world that will also be a better world, she wrote at the end of a long status about women’s rights."
BUSINESS,'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli Gets 7 Years For Defrauding Investors,"Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive who made headlines by jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug before he was found guilty of defrauding investors, was sentenced to 7 years and a $75,000 fine on Friday. The sentence from U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, was shorter than the 15 years asked for by prosecutors but much longer than the 12 to 18 months Shkreli’s lawyers had sought. Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the judge before the sentencing that Shkreli, 34, suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder and was a somewhat broken person, whom the government wanted to throw away. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis had said a 15 year sentence was justified in part because Shkreli’s crimes were not an isolated lapse in judgment, but a pattern of conduct including separate frauds for his two hedge funds and for his drug company Retrophin Inc. The Brooklyn-born entrepreneur became known as the Pharma Bro in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent to $750 per pill. Shkreli was indicted for the unrelated securities fraud charges in December 2015. A jury in August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses. He was also convicted of scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. The $75,000 fine comes on top of $7.36 million in forfeiture Shkreli had already been ordered to pay following his conviction. There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face, Brafman said. Mr. Shkreli is about to turn 35 years old, she said  He is a man who needs to take responsibility for his actions. Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered his social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."
BUSINESS,Health Insurer Cigna To Buy Express Scripts For About $54 Billion,"U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co <ESRX.O> for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs. The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc <AET.N> and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp <CVS.N> announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations. The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price. Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186. The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel. Centerview Partners and Lazard Frères were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel."
BUSINESS,Geek Squad Has Been Turning Customer Data Over To The FBI For More Than A Decade,"Geek Squad employees have been working as FBI informants for more than a decade, newly released documents show, revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported. While we’d previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers’ hard drives, the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies. The documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client’s computer, so it’s hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Seeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told  in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Per the EFF, an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011, was stored on unallocated space on the disk that typically requires forensic software to find. Rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier’s home -- a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad -- was obtained via false and misleading statements. EFF documents show this wasn’t a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company’s repair facility in Kentucky. (The company’s Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer’s data.) Records uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had eight FBI informants at Geek Squad City from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed. As a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography, the company said. Our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer’s problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do — and not do — in these circumstances. We have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the FBI, the company continued. Any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies. Three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned."
BUSINESS,Bumble Bans Gun Photos From Members' Profiles,"In the wake of the Parkland school shooting that left 17 people dead, Bumble announced it will no longer allow members to post any photos of guns or other weapons. The popular app, which was created as a female-first dating service, will search through all of its members’ profiles and remove images with weapons. The company plans to filter out any mention or discussion of guns in written content as well, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told The New York Times. The new policy won’t apply to people working in law enforcement or in the military. Herd said that some gun owners, such as competitive sports shooters, could appeal to the company to keep their gun photos on the site. Online behavior can both mirror and predict how people treat each other in the real world. Bumble has a responsibility to our users and a larger goal to encourage accountability offline. In the past, when we’ve had an opportunity to make our platform safer, we’ve taken action, banning hate speech and inappropriate sexual content from the Bumble app. As mass shootings continue to devastate communities across the country, it’s time to state unequivocally that gun violence is not in line with our values, nor do these weapons belong on Bumble. From today on, we will begin the process of moderating all new and previously uploaded photos for the presence of guns. Our terms and conditions will be updated to reflect this decision. Bumble is also making a $100,000 donation to March For Our Lives, the organization founded by the brave young survivors of the Parkland tragedy. We stand with them, and join them in working towards a non-violent future."
BUSINESS,Judge Orders 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli To Forfeit $7.36 Million,"Former drug company executive Martin Shkreli may have to give up a Picasso and a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album, after a U.S. judge on Monday ordered him to forfeit $7.36 million following his conviction of defrauding investors. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said the assets Shkreli could forfeit to satisfy the judgment also include $5 million in a brokerage account and his stake in Vyera Pharmaceuticals, one of the drug companies he founded. Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair in a Facebook post. Shkreli became notorious as thePharma Bro when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing is now Vyera. In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it. Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting. A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Shkreli’s lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin. Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors’ ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud. Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines."
BUSINESS,"Ride-Hailing Drivers Probably Make Even Less Than They Think, MIT Paper Finds","However much you tip your Uber driver, it’s probably not enough. And however much Uber pays its drivers, it’s almost definitely not enough, either. Those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions. Unlike previous economic analyses that report drivers’ gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car’s depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency. Once those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive. In the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37. Notably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told  the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers’ vehicle of choice by a factor of two. More than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week. It isn’t all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit -- representing billions of dollars -- is going untaxed. At an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue, the paper notes. This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model. Lyft didn’t respond to a request for comment from , but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper’s methodology and findings. While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed, the spokesman said. We’ve reached out to the paper’s authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach. Compared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove.Using the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers’ operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT’s methodology needs to be tweaked -- which is possible, since it’s a working paper --  its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren’t making enough money."
BUSINESS,Papa John's Is No Longer NFL's Official Pizza,"As of Tuesday, Papa John’s is no longer the official pizza of the NFL, according to a joint statement from the National Football League and the pizza chain. Papa John’s CEO Steve Ritchie, who took over from founder John Schnatter on Jan. 1, told investors the company will shift its marketing from the whole NFL and instead focus on specific teams and players, according to Business Insider. Although Papa John’s has been the official pizza of the NFL since 2010, the chain reported that North American sales dropped nearly 4 percent during the last three months of 2017 -- which, if you need a reminder, was football season. Executives blamed the sales slump on negative consumer sentiment. And Schnatter may have been responsible for that. In November, he faced backlash after claiming that NFL players’ kneeling protests were costing Papa John’s money. Schnatter put the blame on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying the NFL hurt Papa John’s shareholders by not resolving the current debacle to the players’ and owners’ satisfaction. Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, told investors that Goodell should have stopped the players from exercising their right to free expression back in 2016. The player protests began when quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee in 2016 during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America."
BUSINESS,Amazon And Whole Foods Disagree On Products Like Coca-Cola,"Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned. When asked if Whole Foods will add consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola, Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don’t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there’s always that consideration. Amazon declined to comment. In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, love at first sight. And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members. Amazon’s plan to change Whole Foods’ shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant’s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon’s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years. While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart’s 25% and Kroger’s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June. Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks. But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name Simply, which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base. It’s painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance. There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction."
EDUCATION,The Controversial Way Some California Schools Are Handling Students' Misbehavior,"The two 9th-grade girls heard the laughing the minute they walked into their third-period class that December morning at Oakland’s Fremont High School. And they knew why: a video of one of the girls being slapped by a classmate had gone viral among students on social media. It was one of those moments that could have gone bad in a hurry — like so many others had at Fremont High, a school that had more suspensions last year than any other in the Oakland Unified School District. Both girls (whose names are being withheld to protect their privacy) acknowledged later that their first instinct was to lash out at their snickering classmates. But they didn’t do that. Instead, they left the classroom and walked down the hall to Tatiana Chaterji’s room. Chaterji is Fremont High’s restorative justice facilitator and among a growing number of educators in Oakland Unified charged with changing the district’s approach to behavioral issues through restorative practices. This work departs from traditional school discipline in that it focuses less on punishment and more on righting wrongs and building healthy relationships within the school. During the previous period, the two girls had participated in a community building circle, a cornerstone of restorative justice in which students gather in a circle, talk about the difficulties of their daily lives and work on responding to them in a healthier way. Had things gotten out of hand, punches might have been thrown. That would’ve led to an office referral and perhaps suspensions. Such an outcome would be an unfortunate but not uncommon occurrence at Fremont, which, according to district data, suspended 151 students during the 2016-17 school year. Fremont High hired Chaterji last summer as part of a larger effort to improve the school’s climate and cut down on suspensions. The school also employs three case managers who work to alleviate conflicts that crop up in classrooms before they become office referrals. Small victories like the one that morning at Fremont High are being won to varying degrees in schools throughout California. Over the past decade, a mountain of research has shown that the so-called zero-tolerance approach to misbehavior, characterized by stringent rules and harsh punishments, largely doesn’t work. In particular, studies have shown unequivocally that students of color are suspended and expelled at disproportionately higher rates than their white peers, which has forced a reassessment of school discipline in many places throughout the nation. Teachers and administrators have come to realize that a student’s range of experiences — their home life, their neighborhood and the overall atmosphere of the school — has an outsized impact on their behavior in class. Research shows that by gaining insight into these experiences and building stronger relationships with students, educators can address a number of behaviors without having to resort to suspensions and other punitive methods of discipline. This awakening, along with intense pressure on districts from the state in recent years to cut down on suspensions, have spawned a number of behavioral support programs under the umbrella of social/emotional learning, including Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) and Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). Although the terms restorative justice and restorative practices were largely unheard of in the school setting as recently as a decade ago, the work in many respects builds on conflict mediation strategies that schools have used since the 1990s. Yet many see restorative justice as groundbreaking because at its core is a repudiation of the punitive model that has been the foundation of school discipline in this country since the days of the one-room schoolhouse."
EDUCATION,California School First In The Nation To Be Digitally Mapped For First Responders,"Among the many disturbing truths that came to light following the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School was that it took Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold only 16 minutes to kill 13 people and wound 21 others. But it took police three hours and 14 minutes to find all of them. One of the contributing factors to the highly criticized law enforcement response to the shooting was that police were using outdated floor plans to guide them in their search. They mistakenly believed the cafeteria and library, where nearly all of the murders occurred, were on the east side of the school. But they had been relocated four years earlier to the west side. More than 19 years later, police nationwide are still lacking crucial information about a school’s layout and what’s inside it when they respond to a shooting or other dangerous situation, experts say. This, however, is no longer the case for Anaheim High School, the first school in the nation to have its every nook and cranny digitally mapped and the files made accessible to first responders on their computers, tablets or phones. This is a game changer, said Julian Harvey, interim chief of the Anaheim Police Department in an interview. It dramatically changes the way and manner in which we respond to incidents at schools. The system is the brainchild of David Sobel, a former Escondido cop who 18 years ago opened his own San Diego-based security consulting firm, The Sobel Group. Sobel said he came up with the concept a decade ago, but had to wait for the technology to catch up before his idea could be turned into something usable for first responders and affordable to schools and other institutions. The images were then loaded into a system that also includes up-to-date floor plans of the school, making it possible for those on the scene and in the command center to see a split-screen, with the image of a room or hallway on one side and the floor plan on the other. This allows first responders to simultaneously do a virtual walk-through of the building and track where they are on the floor plan. It reduces the danger and response time for first responders, while assisting in locating a suspect, Harvey said in a release that preceded a Tuesday news conference. It won’t prevent a shooting, but we know that time is of the essence when dealing with those situations. The system would be especially useful in a situation where a suspect has barricaded himself, and perhaps hostages, in a room, Harvey said. Officers responding would not only be able to pull up information about what’s behind a door — including the number of desks, windows and rear doors — but also the material the door is made of and its locking mechanism. Sobel said it took between three and four weeks to do the digital mapping of Anaheim High and load the images into the system. The price tag for the product is between $25,000 and $30,000 for a large high school, with the cost going down for smaller schools and up for college and university campuses. He estimates that if he were able to properly scale up the operation, it would take about five to seven years to implement the system in the majority of the nation’s schools. Next on the list are the North Orange Continuing Education campus, which is also in Anaheim, and Ramona High School in San Diego County."
EDUCATION,States Are Favoring School Choice At A Steep Cost To Public Education,"Teacher strikes are generating a healthy focus on how far public education funding has fallen over the past decade. The full explanation, however, goes beyond basic funding cuts. It involves systematic advantages in terms of funding, students and teachers for charter schools and voucher programs as compared to traditional public schools. Increasing public teacher salaries may end the current protests, but speaking as an expert in education law and policy, I believe it won’t touch the new normal in which public education is no longer many states’ first priority. My forthcoming research shows that, from funding and management practices to teacher and student policies, states are giving charter schools and private schools a better deal than public schools. These better deals have fueled enormous growth in charter schools and voucher programsthat is now nearly impossible to unwind. The most basic shift occurred between 2008 and 2012. Florida and North Carolina illustrate the nationwide trend. Each cut public education funding by 20 percent or more in three years. During the same period, North Carolina lifted its cap on new charter schools and quickly doubled its charter school spending. Florida similarly changed the rules for its voucher program and quadrupled its size. States also passed laws to offer charters and private schools more money for each student they took. Florida increased the value of each voucher by roughly US $2,000. Nevada went even further, passing legislation that would convert every single public education dollar into a voucher dollar. While the state Supreme Court later declared the program unconstitutional, it has not stopped other states like Arizona from pursuing similar programs. Several states also began lifting income eligibility limits. Previously, states had provided vouchers only for low-income students. But new voucher programs made them available to wealthy students as well, even those who already had access to excellent public schools. Charter schools benefited from similar advantages in some states. Ohio and New Jersey funneled charter school funding through school districts, but the states’ antiquated funding formulas and charter reimbursement rates force districts to send charter schools more per pupil than they receive from the state. Pennsylvania has a similar scheme, but it has proven so lopsided that it expanded deficits in Philadelphia and nearly bankrupted the Chester School District. Chester was paying the local charter school roughly $40,000 per special education student, including for those students with relatively low-cost needs. Arizona took a simpler route. It shielded charter schools from the budget cuts it was imposing on traditional public schools. Even well-meaning charter schools have been unable to stop this profit-taking. The Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, found that state law dictates that everything a private charter school company purchases with public dollars – from desks to computers – belongs to the private company, not the public. The same is true of buildings that charter schools lease. Charter school operators reap their largest profits through unreasonably high lease payments on buildings that the public will never own. States also allow private schools and charters to treat students differently. While public schools must provide disadvantaged students with a host of special services, private schools take vouchers with almost no strings attached. And they are increasingly taking high-achieving middle-income and nondisabled students who cost less to educate and typically do not demand specialized services. Charter schools’ advantages come in their ability to recruit students and cap enrollment. Public schools must serve everyone in their community. The clearest proof that charters don’t is in the data. For instance, Newark charter schools enroll less than half the percentage of special education students and English language learners as the Newark public schools. Newark charters also enroll significantly fewer low-income students. In North Carolina, charter schools are increasingly enrolling white students, while public schools increasingly enroll students of color. In Minneapolis, 80 percent of charters are racially isolated by race, socioeconomic status or both. The current debate over school funding must move beyond teacher salaries and whether the books in public schools are tattered. Those conversations ignore the systematic policies that disadvantage public schools. Increasing public school teachers’ salaries alone won’t fix the problem. The public school teaching force has already shrunk. Class sizes have already risen. And the rules that advantage charter and private schools remain firmly in place. Long-term solutions require a reexamination of these preferences. As a state constitutional matter, the law requires that states make public education their first priority. It is not enough to make education one of several competing priorities. And as a practical matter, states cannot continue to ask public schools to work with whatever is left over and then criticize them for doing a poor job. This cycle creates a circular justification for dismantling public education when states should be repairing it."
EDUCATION,Girls Reportedly Bleeding Through Pants Due To Charter School Bathroom Policy,"A network of Chicago charter schools has policies so strict that some menstruating girls are bleeding through their pants for lack of permitted bathroom breaks, an NPR affiliate reported on Monday. In early April, NPR Illinois outlined the dehumanizing disciplinary practices at the Noble Network of Charter Schools, which has 18 campuses that serve 12,000 students in the area. Teachers and students subsequently reported other practices, including strictly limited bathroom visits. We have [bathroom] escorts, and they rarely come so we end up walking out [of class] and that gets us in trouble, an anonymous student texted to an NPR reporter. But who wants to walk around knowing there’s blood on them? It can still stain the seats. They just need to be more understanding. Feminine hygiene products can leak if they aren’t changed every few hours. Tampons that aren’t changed regularly can cause toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening type of bacterial infection. Noble Network of Charter Schools has carved out an exemption in the dress code so menstruating students who stain their clothes can tie their school sweatshirts around their waists, NPR reported. An email to staff members names the girls who are exempt from the dress code so they don’t garner demerits. Students receive automatic detention after four demerits in a two-week period and are required to take a character development course after 13 such detentions, according to NPR’s first report. Prior to the 2017-2018 school year, Noble schools charged students $140 to take the behavioral course. One teacher told NPR that the school is disconnected from its predominately black student body, and students sometimes resist the stringent policies. One student says it best, ‘When you treat us like animals, what do you think we are gonna act like?’ the teacher told NPR anonymously, for fear of retaliation.  Let me be clear - Noble absolutely accommodates our students during menstruation, including bathroom trips whenever the student needs one, Brewer said in a statement. This is the same accommodation as high schools everywhere, and I would tolerate nothing less from my organization. We love our students and it is our sacred responsibility to ensure their health and safety. We also know that stains are still not 100% preventable for factors that are private to each student, but when they happen, our schools provide supportive solutions as quickly as possible. These solutions include borrowing clean uniform items from the school’s office and covering the stains, as previously mentioned. Our story focused on a range of responses to a previous piece about discipline policies at Noble schools, Cameron said. This issue was one part of the response. As we previously reported Noble discipline policies vary by campus. Sources on several different Noble campuses independently shared experiences about a lack of bathroom access. Additional sources also came forward with similar experiences after publication. We stand by the story. "
EDUCATION,"Desperate For Teachers, Districts Beg Retirees To Come Back","Hymethia W. Thompson was happily retired after 46 years as an educator when she saw a television news conference last summer that changed her life. The interim school superintendent of Jackson, Mississippi, where Thompson lives, issued a plea to retired teachers to come back. The Jackson Public School District was experiencing a shortage of certified teachers and there was a desperate need for qualified former instructors. I hadn’t thought about returning to the classroom, but when I heard they needed certified teachers that badly, I had to help, said Thompson, who won numerous awards during her career as an English, speech and drama teacher in Mississippi and Wisconsin. I called and got the information and a few weeks later I was back in the classroom. Thompson, 70, is among a small cadre of retired educators who returned to Jackson classrooms for the 2017-18 school year to teach science, math and English, the courses for which the school district has the direst need. She is currently teaching 11th grade English at Jackson’s historic Lanier High School, marking the first time the school has had a licensed 11th grade English teacher in four and a half years, she said. Thompson teaches three 90-minute periods per day — equal to six classes. Rural school districts across Mississippi and around the country are facing similar staffing challenges, often made more difficult by their remoteness. Alvin Thornton, former chair of the Maryland Commission on Education Finance, Equity, and Excellence, said bringing back retired teachers may be a good temporary fix for urban and rural districts alike, but it should not be considered a solution. The Maryland group, known as the Thornton Commission, was created to equalize educational opportunities and funding for students in Maryland’s 25 public school districts. He added public school districts also need to get back to the basics that will make them successful: well-paid teachers who live in the communities where they work, small classes and parents and community members who are involved in children’s education. Among the reasons why pay is not competitive, she said, is a state legislature that does not care a whole lot about funding inner city schools. Suburban school districts are growing as Jackson families leave the city, in part because of concern about the underfunded schools, she added. For the students, it’s a situation of ‘Am I getting the best education because I have a sub in the classroom instead of a certified teacher?’ Bender said. For the teachers, it’s class overload. You are working without an assistant and you have 35 students in a classroom, for example a French class or a math class or a science class. You are expected to reach each of those 35 students every class period. That’s an awesome task. JPS has recruited retirees by increasing financial incentives. The district pays them $225 per day, up from $125 per day previously. But hiring retirees is an imperfect solution to the district’s staffing woes; some retired teachers can only work for half a year or they’ll lose their retirement benefits. Others, like Hymethia Thompson, came out of retirement to teach, trading their retirement pay for a regular salary based on their education level and years of experience. That’s why Murray said Jackson is also stepping up efforts to hire new teachers by increasing starting pay and offering curriculum support and professional development opportunities. The school district offered a signing bonus of $2,500 for teachers who were hired this school year, he said. School district officials are also attending job fairs and aggressively pursuing students coming out of college education programs, he added. I like helping the young people, she said. Some of them need so much help and guidance. Things have changed quite a bit since I started teaching. A lot of the kids are behind socially and educationally. Retired Jackson Public Schools teacher Anne Johnson, who now teaches students at her church and volunteers for the Jackson chapter of the NAACP, said the educators who have returned are committed to education in a school system in which good teachers have the potential to make a big difference in children’s lives. Teaching is a ministry, said Johnson. You teach because you are interested in helping children be the best they can be. Sometimes it’s not something that you can just put down, especially when you know there is a need. You have spent years helping children to learn and thrive. It’s difficult not to respond when you hear there is such a significant need."
EDUCATION,Why More School Districts Are Holding Class Just Four Days A Week,"The public school in Campo, Colorado, hasn’t required all its students to come to class on Fridays for nearly two decades. The 44-student district dropped a weekday to boost attendance and better attract teachers to a town so deep in farm country that the nearest grocery store is more than 20 miles away. I think the four-day week helped us, initially, in recruiting teachers, the superintendent, Nikki Johnson, said. Now that so many districts are on four-day, that’s not much of an incentive. No national database tracks the number of public schools that cram instructional hours into four days. But the schedule — long popular in rural Western communities — is becoming more common elsewhere as school leaders search for ways to both attract teachers and save money. Shorter school weeks are generally popular among families, students and teachers, and many school districts say the change saves money and makes it easier to recruit teachers. But the research is inconclusive: Shorter school weeks save only a little, according to education policy researchers. The impact on staffing hasn’t been well studied, and results are mixed on whether cramming a week’s worth of learning into four days helps or hurts students’ learning. In some districts, schools have been meeting four days a week for decades. The schedule gained fresh popularity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when districts responded to budget cuts by shedding a day. Surveys generally show support for four-day weeks among parents and teachers, according to districts, states and education researchers who have asked adults about the schedule. In rural communities, where students travel long distances for sports games, academic competitions and doctors appointments, it can be efficient to set aside a weekday for extracurricular and family activities, according to the Colorado four-day week information manual. Dropping a school day can create new challenges for communities, however, and it’s not clear whether students benefit. Since District 27J announced its plan to drop Monday classes, parents have crowded information sessions with questions and flooded social media with comments. In most Colorado communities with four-day schools, however, the issue of baby-sitting seems to be a wash, the state information manual says. That’s because with the longer school day, children get home closer to when their parents do. Parents may find it no more difficult to find child care for a full day than for a few hours every afternoon, the manual says. Fifth-day activities, like after-school activities, can offer students a rich set of learning experiences, Heyward said. The question is whether districts on a four-day schedule can afford them. These are all districts that are struggling financially, or they wouldn’t even consider moving to this schedule, she said."
EDUCATION,"Beyoncé Announces $100,000 In Scholarships For HBCU Students","Beyoncé will give $25,000 to four historically black colleges and universities for the 2018-2019 school year as part of a new scholarship program that was inspired by the singer’s historic Coachella performance this past weekend. One student from each HBCU -- Xavier University of Louisiana, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University -- will receive the money. To qualify for the Homecoming Scholars Award Program, applicants need to have at least a 3.5 GPA. Each university will select its own finalists and winner, with winners set to be announced sometime this summer. The scholarship program is Beyoncé’s second through her philanthropic BeyGOOD initiative. Last year, BeyGood’s Formation Scholars Awards Program gave money to students studying creative arts, music, literature or African-American studies at Berklee College of Music, Parsons School of Design, Howard University and Spelman College. Those scholarships were in commemoration of the one-year anniversary of the singer’s visual album, Lemonade. The announcement for the Homecoming Scholars Award Program ties the gifts to the Coachella performance, saying the show put the spotlight on art and culture, mixing the ancient and the modern, and was the impetus to mark her second scholarship program. BeyGood also has a partnership with UNICEF for an effort called BeyGood 4 Burundi. The initiative, announced last year, aims to improve water, sanitation and basic hygiene practices in the East African nation of Burundi, where nearly half the population had no access to clean, safe water.

EDUCATION,Kentucky Is Learning That You Can't Have School Without Teachers,"School districts across Kentucky will once again shut down as teachers plan to flood the state Capitol on Friday to rally for public-school funding and protest newly signed changes to public pension programs. As of Thursday afternoon, at least 36 districts had decided to close Friday, citing teachers calling in sick or the likelihood that they would. The closures include public schools in Louisville and Lexington -- the two largest school districts in the state. Friday will mark at least the third day of widespread forced closures since Kentucky’s state Legislature passed the pension overhaul in a late-night vote two weeks ago. The day after the vote, teachers called in sick and closed schools in more than 25 counties. We’re encouraging people to show up in force and make sure our legislators and our governor hear loud and clear that we shall not be moved, said Gay Adelmann, the co-founder and president of Save Our Schools Kentucky. The nonprofit advocacy group has organized protests in Frankfort throughout the 2018 legislative session and will demonstrate again Friday. Kentucky’s teacher protests, unlike those in West Virginia and Oklahoma, have focused largely on pension changes. The overhaul, which Gov. Matt Bevin (R) signed into law Wednesday, includes small reforms that will reduce benefits for some current teachers and public employees, and will also convert pensions into hybrid 401(k)-style plans for new hires. The pension legislation, however, was merely the spark that set ablaze decades of teacher frustration over education funding and the treatment of Kentucky’s public schools.Teachers have been easy targets for a long time, said Travis Gay, a teacher in Adair County who has helped organize teachers through Facebook groups and grassroots campaigns. But now, he said, it’s even worse. I don’t think there is any way to look at it other than as an attack on public education, Gay said. So while Kentucky teachers held smaller protests throughout the first three months of the year, they were pushed over the edge by the pension bill and the manner in which it was passed: Republican leaders attached it at the last minute to unrelated public wastewater legislation. At last week’s rally in Frankfort, teacher after teacher called that moment a breaking point. Not all of them have hit education, but many have. As a result, the funding gaps between poor rural districts and larger, wealthier ones that sparked the 1990 education reform effort have begun to widen again. Educators, meanwhile, have been forced to teach with outdated textbooks that haven’t been replaced in years. Louisville teacher Andrew Bailey told  last week that he hasn’t received new books since 2008. As in other states, teachers have increasingly had to purchase supplies for their classrooms with their own money. And as Kentucky educators have drawn inspiration from teachers in Oklahoma and West Virginia, they have begun to organize in new ways. Bevin may lay blame for teacher opposition at the feet of unions like the Kentucky Education Association and the Jefferson County Teachers Association -- members of which he said were acting with a thug mentality -- but teachers said the protests are largely the result of grassroots organizing. They credit groups like Save Our Schools Kentucky and Kentucky 120 United, which has created regional Facebook groups to connect teachers across the state."
EDUCATION,Parkland School District Votes Against Arming Teachers,"The Florida school district that includes Parkland, the city where a mass shooting in February left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has decided not to arm its teachers. Broward County Public Schools officials on Tuesday unanimously voted against participating in a program that would train some faculty members to carry guns. The state legislature recently passed a school safety law that created the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program. The plan, named after the Stoneman Douglas football coach killed in Feb. 14 shooting, allocates $67 million for sheriff’s offices affiliated with participating school districts. President Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have pushed for arming more teachers with guns in the wake of the Parkland shooting. But many gun safety advocates, including survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre, have railed against the idea. Teachers are meant to be educators, Alfonso Calderon, a junior at Stoneman Douglas high school, told CNN in February. They are meant to teach young minds how to work in the world. They are not meant to know how to carry AR-15s. They are not meant to know how to put on Kevlar vests for the other students or for themselves. Tuesday’s decision marks the second time the school board has voted on whether to arm teachers in the wake of the Parkland shooting. On March 6, the school board unanimously passed a resolution that opposes asking or incentivizing teachers to keep weapons in their classroom. I have not met one teacher or one student who is in favor of arming teachers in Broward County, Laurie Rich Levinson, a school board member, said during the school board meeting Tuesday. I support arming and having these type of weapons only in the hands of our law enforcement officers."
EDUCATION,Pennsylvania School District Arms 500 Teachers With Mini Baseball Bats,"A Pennsylvania school district is arming its roughly 500 teachers with 16-inch baseball bats in an effort to boost security in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. Teachers in the Millcreek Township School District, located in the the state’s northwest corner, received the mini bats after a training day on how to respond to school shootings, reported Erie News Now. The bats, which will be kept locked in each classroom, are mostly symbolic, Hall said. Unfortunately, we’re in a day and age where one might need to use them to protect ourselves and our kids, Hall told the outlet. If an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance to any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full of students armed with rocks, and they will be stoned, Blue Mountain School District Superintendent David Helsel told the state House Education Committee. Mass shooters, including the one whose Feb. 14 attack on a Parkland, Florida, high school killed 17 people, often have equipped themselves with assault-style rifles capable of firing dozens of rounds in seconds. Such high-powered, military-style weapons would render mini baseball bats and stones unlikely defensive tools."
EDUCATION,"Hey, Laura Ingraham, David Hogg Actually Did Get Into UC Irvine","Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg, famously mocked by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham for not getting into several University of California schools, actually did get accepted to UC Irvine, according to TMZ. Hogg, who has become a leading advocate for stronger gun laws in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre at his high school in Florida, told TMZ Sunday that he received an acceptance letter from Irvine last week. The outlet reported previously that Hogg had been rejected by that school and UCLA, San Diego and Santa Barbara despite a high grade-point average. Ingraham last month ridiculed Hogg on Twitter for failing to gain entry into the colleges. The backlash was fierce. Hogg encouraged his Twitter followers to contact Ingraham’s sponsors. Several advertisers dropped the show, and the host departed on vacation. Ingraham is scheduled to return to the air on The Ingraham Angle Monday night. Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who rallied supporters at the March For Our Lives demonstration last month in Washington, didn’t say whether he accepted the offer to attend UC Irvine. He didn’t immediately respond to a  request for comment. U.S. News and World Report ranked UC Irvine ninth among public universities and 42nd among universities nationally."

EDUCATION,Puerto Rico To Shutter 283 More Schools This Summer As Education Crisis Deepens,"In another bleak development for Puerto Rico’s decimated education system, the island’s Department of Education announced Thursday that it would close an additional 283 schools this summer, a 25 percent reduction in the current number of public schools. Puerto Rico Education Secretary Julia Keleher said a sharp decline in student enrollment and the territory’s ongoing economic crisis, especially since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, had prompted the closures. Almost half of all schools are at less than 60 percent of enrollment capacity, Keleher said, with nearly 39,000 fewer students than a year ago. Officials have said several thousand more students are expected to leave the island for the mainland to continue their education in the coming years. We know it’s a difficult and painful process, Keleher said of the impending closures, according to The Associated Press. Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them, taking into account Puerto Rico’s fiscal reality. The closures are expected save the education department about $150 million, said Keleher. She stressed, however, that no teachers would be laid off but some would be transferred between schools. Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in September, dealt a major blow to Puerto Rico’s education system, which had already been suffering from an enrollment slump. Last summer, 179 public schools on the island were shuttered and 150 more were closed from 2010 to 2015. Following the new spate of closures, just 828 public schools will remain open, AP reported. Teachers and parents have reacted with fury and frustration to the new closures. This is like killing 300 communities, Aida Díaz, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, told Education Week. We’re going to have communities that are not going to have any schools. The only place they have to meet is the school. The association said the school closures would affect 60,000 students and 6,000 teachers, reported Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Dia newspaper. Díaz estimated that 4,000 non-tenured teachers would leave their jobs regardless of the Education Department’s no-layoffs promise. I don’t even know where the schools they’re being located to are, Haydee Del Valle, whose 12-year-old son will need to transfer, told NBC News on Friday. I don’t know if they’re too far away from us or if the school bus they take now will be able to take them there. This makes me sad because this is a great school, she added. Díaz criticized the Education Department for not being transparent about how it decided which schools to close, noting that 45 of the schools had been recognized as schools of excellence. Thursday’s closure announcement comes on the heels of a controversial education reform bill signed in March by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. The bill aims to introduce a charter school pilot program and private school vouchers for 3 percent of students. Thousands of teachers went on strike on March 19 to protest the bill. They think that because our island is vulnerable, because it doesn’t have electricity, that we’re going to let them privatize our schools, get rid of our teachers, Mercedes Martínez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation, told NPR in March of the reform effort.

EDUCATION,Oklahoma Teachers Begin 110-Mile March To Protest Education Funding,"Educators in Oklahoma are making it clear they aren’t giving up in their fight for increased public school funding. On Wednesday, more than 100 people set out from Webster High School in Tulsa on a seven-day trek to the state Capitol in Oklahoma City to demand bigger education budgets. We are willing to walk 100 miles for our students, Patti Ferguson-Palmer, president of the Tulsa Classroom Teachers Association, told The Tulsa World. What is the Oklahoma Legislature willing to do? We are not all young and fit. Wednesday marked the third day straight that Oklahoma teachers and their supporters have protested years of deep cuts and salary slashes for educators. On Monday, teachers across the state staged a massive revolt when they walked out of schools, with many swarming the Capitol building in Oklahoma City. Why are we walking? Alicia Priest, Oklahoma Education Association president, asked on Monday. There are 700,000 reasons why: our students. And they deserve better. … They see broken chairs in class, outdated textbooks that are duct-taped together, and class sizes that have ballooned. Thousands of teachers were off the job again on Tuesday, with many school districts announcing they would remain shut down for at least the rest of the week. Oklahoma is better than this, and educators will continue to walk out until we get a deal that our students deserve, Priest said. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Mary Fallin compared teachers wanting better resources to a teenager wanting a better car."
EDUCATION,"Teachers Swarm Kentucky Capitol To Protest Pension Changes, School Budget Cuts","Thousands of teachers and public workers from across Kentucky flocked to the state Capitol on Monday morning to protest potential budget cuts to public education and the passage, last week, of a controversial package of changes to the state’s public pension system that teachers had opposed. The rally began before 9 a.m. outside the Kentucky Education Association building just blocks from the Capitol complex. Teachers, most of them clad in red (as part of the grassroots Wear Red for Ed campaign), later marched to the Capitol itself, filling up the rotunda outside legislative chambers and spilling out the front doors and down the steps. Enough is enough, they chanted, many of them carrying signs telling lawmakers to fully fund their pensions and their schools and threatening that if the legislators failed to do so, the teachers would do everything in their power to remove them from office in elections this November. We feel demoralized, we feel assaulted and we feel like we’ve been marginalized, said Chris Wilder, a teacher at Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg. We’re angry. Teachers have filled the Capitol complex off and on for more than a month in an effort to derail pension changes and education budget cuts proposed by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Republican majority leaders in both chambers of the legislature. But their anger boiled over Thursday night when GOP lawmakers attached a slate of pension changes to a previously unrelated bill meant to address public sewage issues. Hours later, both the state House and state Senate approved the measures on party-line votes. The way they introduced this bill was the linchpin, the insulting part, Wilder said. We’re basically equivalent to excrement. It’s like, ‘This is what we think of you and your contribution to our state. Nothing. You don’t matter.’ But we matter, and our kids matter."
EDUCATION,Lullaby Of Algebra: How Mixing Music And Math Helps Engage Students,"Anything that’s an algorithm, I have a song for it, said the energetic middle-school math teacher in Hayward Unified, in the east Bay Area. I must have 100 songs. At least. Jorgensen, who teaches 7th- and 8th-grade math, leads her students in ditties, chants and dance moves to help them remember basic formulas in algebra and geometry. A lesson on monomial exponent rules becomes Jorgensen said that weaving music into math lessons has boosted her students’ test scores, enhanced their understanding of the larger concepts, improved the classroom climate and accomplished something few would think possible of middle-school math: Made it fun. Many studies, including one in the journal Memory and Cognition, have shown that information set to music is easier to remember. It’s how epics like The Iliad and The Odyssey were passed down through the centuries, and how toddlers learn their ABCs and 123s. People with Alzheimer’s disease might not be able to remember their spouse, but can often recite songs from their youth. A 2009 study by a UC Davis psychology researcher, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, found that the region of the brain that stores memories is the same region that processes music and emotion. In short, music, memory and emotion are closely linked. Song and dance serve well to help us remember lyrics, or in this case math formulas, said Patricia Swanson, a math education professor at San Jose State University. And, indeed, there are strong conceptual connections between math and music. Perhaps the most obvious one at the elementary level is rhythm and the value of the musical note — 4/4 time, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes …  Jorgensen observes this daily in her classes at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, where 75 percent of the students come from low-income families and 72 percent speak English as a second language. On and off throughout their lessons, students sing math formulas and do math-related dance moves. Some of the songs are pop tunes in which Jorgensen swapped out lyrics about Bacardi and ice and replaced them with lines about n factors and variables. Others are songs that she and students make up. With an associate’s degree in musical theater, Jorgensen has a natural affinity for singing and dancing and knows firsthand how they can aid in memorization and elevate one’s spirits. Such musical activities lead students to enjoy math, which in turn leads them to learn more, Jorgensen said. And during tests, remembering math songs helps them relax and feel good, so they’re less likely to panic, she said. Seventh-grader Mia Espiritu, one of Jorgensen’s students, said she never enjoyed math until this year. She and most of her classmates in fourth period had scored below grade level on previous standardized tests, but Mia said she’s finally understanding the concepts. Ms. J.J. teaches us new things every day, so it’s not boring, she said. And if I get stuck, I always have a song in my mind that helps me remember. I used to not get math. Now I do get it. Her classmate Guadalupe Gonzalez agreed. Math was always a struggle, but now she enjoys it. The songs help explain it better, she said. Memorizing basic formulas can make it easier for students to grasp larger, more abstract mathematical concepts because students’ minds aren’t mired in the minutiae, Jorgensen said. For example, it’s easier to understand the square root of 36 if you already know the answer to 6 multiplied by 6. Jorgensen’s method has yielded results. In her 8th-grade geometry class from last year, 23 of her 40 students had perfect scores on the Smarter Balanced exam, and in the 7th-grade algebra class, every student exceeded the standards, she said. Seven of those students had perfect scores. It makes me excited about the students’ futures, she said. It opens doors for them and shows what they can achieve if they put in the effort. Mark Ellis, a math education professor at California State University, Fullerton, said he observed elementary teachers in Japan using songs and chants to successfully teach math to their students and he has used music to help low-performing middle-school students learn their multiplication tables. Music in a classroom can relax students, take some pressure off and help teachers forge a cultural connection to their students, he said. He cited a 2014 article in the journal Educational Studies in Mathematics about teachers who were highly successful using songs, chants and music to motivate students in underserved communities. But it’s not the end of the story, he said. Music itself cannot teach kids to understand mathematics, he said. Music can help students improve dramatically, but ultimately math is not about memorization. It’s about reasoning, seeing patterns, making conjectures. It’s about meaning. Memorizing formulas will only be effective in the long run if students understand the concepts underlying the formulas, he said. Ideally, students should be able to come up with formulas on their own, with guidance from the teacher. In some cases, it’s not even necessary to memorize formulas because so many students have calculators on their phones, he said. But either way, students with self-confidence and a solid math education in middle school are well positioned to thrive in the more challenging and abstract math classes they’ll encounter in high school and college, he said. Middle school math is the critical juncture where students transition from arithmetic to more complex concepts about proportions, ratios and multiplication, which are the basis of advanced level math courses. Eighth-grader Jennifer Silva, a student of Jorgensen’s who also helps her teach younger students, said she’s enjoyed math so much she wants to pursue it in college. Doing the chants helps me remember what we learned, she said. When you’re in a test and you feel stressed, you just think of a chant and it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I remember that.’ And then it’s kind of fun."
EDUCATION,Threat Assessments Crucial To Prevent School Shootings,"In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a wide variety of groups – from students to lawmakers – have been searching for ways to make U.S. schools and communities safer and prevent further shootings. One of the best ways to make schools safer is to use threat assessments – a tool developed by law enforcement to protect public figures. In my opinion as one who has studied youth violence for 34 years – and as a forensic psychologist who has worked with many violent youth, including several who have committed shootings at school – I believe the time has come to use threat assessments to protect the nation’s schools. The first thing to recognize is that violence in schools is just a small part of the larger problem of gun violence in American society. It would be a mistake, in my view, to focus only on schools and miss the bigger picture. Children are exposed to violence in many other settings in their communities. Over the past 20 years, the United States has experienced an average of 22 students murdered at school each year. However, outside of schools, an average of 1,480 students are murdered annually. In other words, students are 67 times more likely to be murdered outside of school than at school. There is understandable public alarm that there have been approximately 300 school shootings since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. However, according to CDC reports, there have been over 500,000 shootings outside of schools in those five years, or about 275 shootings every day, resulting in approximately 92 deaths and 183 injuries. From this perspective, U.S. schools are much safer than the surrounding community. The nation does not have a school violence problem but a gun violence problem. What I would point out here is that there is a credible body of scientific research that we can reduce gun violence with reasonable gun laws. The nation’s response to gun violence is often an emotional reaction of increasing security and preparing for the next shooting, rather than supporting efforts to prevent gun violence. It has been reported that schools spent US $5 billion in security measures after the Sandy Hook shooting. Even if schools spend $5 billion more and could somehow make every school impregnable, that would stop only a small fraction of the shootings. For every shooting in a school, there are more than 1,600 shootings outside of school. Why would it make sense to spend billions to stop one-tenth of 1 percent and ignore the 99.9 percent of gun violence? Prevention must start long before there is a gunman in the parking lot, and it requires, in my view, a three-tiered public health approach. The first tier is universal programs for everyone, such as improving school climate so that all children can succeed in school. Many of the mass shootings in schools and communities are committed by individuals who developed anger and resentment because of the bullying, harassment and discrimination they experienced at school. Schools should routinely measure and improve their school climate. On the second tier, prevention means helping troubled young people who are at risk before they start down the pathway toward violence. Put an armed guard in a school and you might prevent one shooting in one building. Put a counselor or psychologist in a school and you have the potential to prevent shootings in any building anywhere in your community. The third tier is to identify and intervene with students who are moving down a pathway toward violence, which brings me to threat assessment and how it works."
EDUCATION,How American High Schools Teach The Iraq War,"American troops have been in Iraq longer than the average high school freshman has been alive. But for the most part, the deadliest U.S. military intervention since the Vietnam War remains a footnote in America’s social studies classrooms. Fifteen years after the U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, teachers and education leaders are still trying to find ways to teach students about an intervention that has yet to end. The challenges teachers face are obvious: In a world where there is always too much to teach and standardized tests reign supreme, recent history tends to get left behind, even if this history is essential for understanding modern geopolitics. Content requirements in social studies classrooms vary by state. Beyond that, experts say the handling of this issue likely varies by district. Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, reviewed how some major textbooks handled the Iraq War for the war’s 10th anniversary and was impressed with the books’ complex and multi-sided perspectives on the issue.

EDUCATION,The West Virginia Teacher Strike Not Over Yet,"The tentative deal struck Tuesday night to end a statewide teacher strike in West Virginia is on shaky ground just hours after being announced by Gov. Jim Justice (R), with employees in some counties pondering whether to extend a walkout that seemed to be over. Striking teachers continued to fill the halls of the state capitol in Charleston on Wednesday despite the day being billed as a cooling off period before schools would reopen on Thursday. Many of them demanded that the unions and legislators get back to the bargaining table to improve a deal they deemed unsatisfactory. The arrangement Justice rolled out would give teachers and other school personnel a five percent raise, and workers employed by the state a three percent raise. Although it marked progress from the meager wage increases earlier proposed by Justice, the deal did not placate strikers’ bigger concerns over the state employee health care program. Justice said the state would temporarily freeze employee costs under the program, known as the Public Employee Insurance Agency (PEIA), while a task force was set up to develop a long-term fix to rising premiums and co-pays. But many striking employees apparently don’t trust the issue will be resolved, and fear increased health costs could wipe away their raises. The director of the West Virginia Education Association, one of the two state unions leading the strike, told The Charleston Gazette Mail on Wednesday that we’ll wait and see whether the strike continues. Jenny Santilli, a Spanish teacher protesting at the Capitol on Wednesday, said many teachers would have rejected the deal had union leaders put it up for a vote. Santilli was upset that the health care issue remained in play, and that state workers would have to settle for smaller pay increases than educators. We’re furious, she said. All hell is breaking loose. Striking workers weren’t the only ones to find out the details of the deal when it was announced at a press conference by Justice Tuesday night. A Republican source who asked to remain anonymous said many GOP legislators learned of the deal in a caucus meeting while watching Justice live on television. Shouting erupted from members upset with the offer. Teachers and other school employees first walked off the job last Thursday, with the workers in all 55 counties onboard with the first such major strike in West Virginia since 1990. Teachers have not seen an across-the-board pay hike since 2014, and increasing health care costs mean take-home pay has gone down for some. West Virginia ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, according to the National Education Association. Public-sector workers do not have collective bargaining rights in West Virginia. Unlike in most other states, unions do not negotiate contracts for their members spelling out pay and benefits, then have members vote on them; instead, the unions must pressure the state legislature to pass bills. As of Wednesday afternoon, all employees had was the governor’s word that legislators would take up and approve his proposal. Santilli said many teachers in her area, Harrison County, were leaning toward continuing the strike on Thursday. While the strike so far has shut down schools across the state, it’s possible dissatisfaction with the deal could lead to reopenings in some counties but not others, splintering what had been a unified strike under the banner of #55strong. Greg Cruey, a teacher and union representative at his school in McDowell County, said he believed union leaders struck a good deal under the circumstances. He called the raise more than we’ve gotten in a long, long time. He said he was satisfied that unions would have a place on the task force formed to address the state employee health plan, and added that teachers could walk out again if legislators don’t follow through on their end of the proposed deal. But Cruey acknowledged that many of his colleagues think quite differently, and that the historic strike might not yet be over. There a lot of discord and confusion and unhappiness, he said. It won’t surprise me if there are a few more strike days. The question is whether the union will stick together in solidarity, and whether ‘55 united’ means something or whether we’ll eat our young instead."
EDUCATION,Tentative Deal Reached To End West Virginia Teacher Strike,"West Virginia officials reached a tentative deal Tuesday to end the strike by teachers and other public employees that closed schools across the state for four days, according to Republican Gov. Jim Justice. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Justice said the state agreed to give teachers and other school personnel a 5 percent raise and state employees a 3 percent raise, marking what could be a major victory for employees to cap the first statewide walkout in nearly three decades. But Justice offered no clear plan to fix the shortfall in the state employee health care program, which was at the top of many workers’ lists of demands. Teachers are expected to return to school on Thursday after a cooling off period on Wednesday. The arrangement still needs to be approved by the state legislature, and union leaders said they reserve the right to reinstate the strike if the deal falls through. This has been a huge step in the right direction, said Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, one of the two teacher unions that led the strike. Teachers and other school employees in all 55 counties across the state were onboard with the strike, making an unprecedented show of solidarity after years of stagnant wages. West Virginia is ranked 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay and is wrestling with a teacher shortage that’s left 700 positions unfilled. The governor acknowledged some missteps in his handling of the work stoppage, saying he started to think differently about it after a conversation with a student. To be perfectly honest, in a lot of ways I was looking at this maybe not correctly, Justice said. I was looking at it as what was the prudent thing to do, and maybe not at education as an investment. I went home and thought a lot about it. Campbell said the raises were offered only because workers had the courage to walk off the job. They did this by standing up, she said. This isn’t the end; this is the beginning. If things get better, then we can really start focusing on the investment in public education."
EDUCATION,Why West Virginia Teachers Are On Their First Strike In 28 Years,"When Katie Cole recently missed three days of work due to a medical emergency, her West Virginia school was stretched too thin to provide her classroom with a qualified substitute teacher. Instead, her room full of preschool special-needs children was helmed by a teacher’s aide with the help of a parent. We just don’t have enough substitutes, said Cole, who’s 24 and in her second year of teaching. Striking teachers with stories like Cole’s have flooded the halls of the West Virginia capitol since last week. Schools across the state have been shut down for three days in an unprecedented show of force by teachers and public employees in all counties. The workers and their unions are demanding more funding for the public employee health plan and raises significant enough to offset several lean years without them. But in interviews, school employees who traveled from across the state to Charleston said the fight was about much more than their paychecks. West Virginia is one of the few U.S. states with a falling population. As the state grapples with a severe teacher shortage, many educators worry their younger peers will continue to flee for greener pastures, with long-term consequences for successive generations of students. A series of business tax cuts have left the state with little money to give public servants who’ve been waiting for meaningful raises. West Virginia now ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, and it was one of just five states to see average teacher pay go down in 2016, according to the National Education Association. Of West Virginia’s 55 counties, more than half border a state with better teacher pay. And the state was trying to fill 700 vacant positions as of last spring. There’s just no reason to stay here, especially the ones who aren’t married, said Patty Hamilton, a second-grade teacher with 30 years at the same elementary school. It’s very sad that this is happening. As one protester’s sign outside the capitol succinctly put it, Country Roads: Leading teachers out of West Virginia."
EDUCATION,Universities Tell Applicants That Protesting Gun Violence Won’t Affect Admissions,"High school students protesting gun violence have found an ally in university admissions officials. A growing number of universities are showing their support to applicants in high school who are disciplined by their administrators for participating in gun violence protests. Support for these students came this week after school administrators threatened to punish students who participated in the ongoing protests motivated by last week’s horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. Fed up with the violence, droves of students have spoken out in support of stricter gun laws and staged nationwide campus walkouts on Wednesday to demand that lawmakers implement common-sense gun control. Individual admissions officials on Twitter reassured peaceful protesters that they wouldn’t let any negative marks from the demonstrations affect their college acceptance decisions. Some universities even issued official statements on the matter. Stu Schmill, the dean of admissions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a Thursday statement that any student records of applicants attending peaceful protests would not negatively impact MIT’s admissions outcome. We have long held that students should not make decisions based on what they think will get them into college, but instead based on values and interests that are important to them, Schmill wrote. We always encourage students to undertake whatever course of action in life is most meaningful to, and consistent with, their own principles, and not prioritize how it might impact their college applications. Other institutions who are taking a stand with the students include the University of Connecticut, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and others. Curtis Rhodes, the superintendent of Needville Independent School District in Houston, Texas, was one of the first school officials to warn students against participating in peaceful protests during school hours. The administrator said any demonstrators would receive a three-day suspension. Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness, Rhodes wrote in a statement reportedly sent to parents. Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension. Some students who have tried to protest gun violence at school have faced pushback from schools. Ben Gamla Preparatory Academy in Hollywood, Florida, reportedly agreed to let their students protest during school hours for 17 minutes in the school parking lot, but when students tried to start the demonstration, they found that the school’s gates were locked. Security personnel brought students who tried to jump the fence back to class, according to local ABC affiliate WPLG-TV. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas responded to Rhodes on Wednesday with a reminder that school administrators are barred from censoring political speech and that punishing students more harshly for protesting is illegal."
EDUCATION,West Virginia Teachers Are Making Sure Their Students Get Fed While They're On Strike,"Once it became clear West Virginia schools would close for a statewide teacher walkout this week, staffers from Nitro High School came up with a plan to keep hungry students fed while school was out. The school normally puts out backpacks of free food on Fridays for students to take home for the weekend, leaving them in a few discreet spots so kids in need can grab them without embarrassment. This week, teachers and administrators increased the number of packs and left them out on Wednesday, so kids could make it through the strike on Thursday and Friday, then on through the weekend, without hunger pangs. Even when we know a big snow is coming, we [make sure] those kids will get those backpacks, said Megan Meadows, a counselor at the school, which is in Kanawha County. The teachers would have caught state officials off guard if they’d walked off the job with little notice. Instead, they announced their two-day walkout five days ahead of time -- in part so that undernourished students wouldn’t be left in the lurch. Roughly 1 child in 4 in the state lives in poverty, one of the highest rates in the country. One the reasons that we didn’t just go out overnight was to give people time to plan, to think about this food issue, and to also allow parents time to sort out what they would do with their children for two days, said Kym Randolph, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association, one of the unions leading the two-day strike. We tried to make allowances so that no one would go hungry. As ABC7 reported, teachers and volunteers filled a gymnasium in Martinsburg ahead of the strike, packing donations from local food pantries to give to students on Wednesday. For a lot of our children, the meals they get at school are the only meals they get for the day, Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, told . Teachers and other public employees in all of West Virginia’s 55 counties are taking part in the walkout. Teachers have not seen an across-the-board raise since 2014, and rising health care costs mean that some teachers have actually seen their take-home pay go down. They are demanding salary raises and a fix to the state’s public employee health insurance fund so premiums don’t continue to rise."
EDUCATION,The Simple Way A Growing Number Of States Are Hoping To Improve Kids' Brains,"Middle school students at Kaleidoscope Academy, a district charter school in Appleton, Wisconsin, are constantly moving. Everyone has a physical education class, called phy-ed here, at least twice a week. On top of that, there’s a daily lunch break that comes with time for kids to get outside and move around. Students can also choose from two additional exercise-focused electives — dance and personal fitness — which for some students can mean a 40-minute exercise period every day. And the action doesn’t stop there. Teachers like Lisa Sackman in the sixth-grade wing offer brain breaks every 20 minutes. Teacher Travis Olsen has an exercise bike in the back of his seventh-grade science classroom that kids are welcome to use whenever they feel the need. And eighth-grade co-teachers Abby Jolma and Toni Giebel let kids sit on wobbly chairs — short stools with a curved base — yoga balls, or traditional chairs while they learn math and science. They need it, Giebel says of the bouncing and fidgeting she now observes constantly during classes. They need it so bad. Giebel said it’s clear to her that students concentrate better than they did three years ago when there were far fewer options for physical activity at school. But the kids themselves don’t notice it, she added. Indeed, students are mostly unimpressed with how much movement they get in their day. During a group science lab in Giebel and Jolma’s class, Anna Wang, 13, sat on one of the wobbly chairs the school purchased for classrooms this year. It was the only option, Anna, 13, said with a shrug as she rocked back and forth on the chair, adding that she didn’t think the seating made any difference. Despite her stated disinterest, the level of physical activity Anna and her classmates experience during their school day is unusual and probably beneficial. In the U.S., where 31 percent of children between the ages of 10 and 17 are obese, most school children move far too little, experts say. Thirty years of focus on increasing academic minutes in the school day has resulted in reduced recess and physical education time at many schools. The lack of physical activity is taking a toll on student fitness and that’s bad for growing brains, research shows. But now a growing number of politicians and educators, like those in Appleton, have begun to heed the research and decided that to improve academic performance, they must do something about their students’ physical fitness as well. As a result of this new attitude, at least 14 state legislatures considered new laws in 2016 that would increase the amount of physical education or recess schools are required to offer or raise the bar for qualifications for physical education teachers, according to a 2016 report by the Society for Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE). Some even took action. Florida and Rhode Island now mandate 20 minutes of recess time a day for elementary school students. The new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, also provides increased access to funding for physical education by including the subject in its definition of a well-rounded education. At least we’re at the table now, said Carly Wright, advocacy director for SHAPE. It sends a message: The federal government does believe [physical education] should be part of a student’s education; it should be part of the school day. Charles Hillman, a kinesiology professor at Northeastern University in Boston who studies the connection between the body and the brain, says there’s strong evidence that supports making physical education and recess a priority in schools. The goal is to get kids moving throughout the school day, Hillman said. While he grants that academic class time is also important, clearly the academic at this point is at the cost of being physically active, and I think there has to be some level of accommodation. Hillman also cautions that physical activity alone has not been shown to increase cognitive performance. A slow walk for example, does little to make anyone smarter. What is definitely tied to brain health, Hillman said, is physical fitness. Effects are actually found in the brain, Hillman said. We find higher fit kids have differential brain function than lower fit kids. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of physically fit children are better developed than those of less fit children, Hillman said. These two brain structures control many of the abilities that lead to high academic achievement: long-term memory, self-regulation and goal making, among other key functions. Hillman, who is advising the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the latest exercise research for the 2018 revision of the department’s recommendations for physical fitness, said that evidence of a connection between fitness and brain function has mounted steadily over the years. A 2009 Stanford University study found that fifth, seventh and ninth grade students in California who passed the state physical fitness test and those whose fitness improved between fifth and seventh grade scored better than their less fit peers on the state’s standardized tests. A 2013 study of nearly 12,000 Nebraska students also found that aerobically fit students were more likely to pass the state’s standardized math and reading tests, regardless of their weight or socioeconomic status. Another 2013 study that randomly assigned 8- and 9-year-old Illinois children to a nine-month after-school fitness program found that the kids whose fitness improved also got better at paying attention and ignoring distractions. They also improved to young-adult levels in their ability to regulate their behavior. School districts that have added more physical activity to their daily schedules in the hope of improving academic performance have also seen measurable changes. When a Ft. Worth, Texas school made a much-publicized switch for its kindergarten and first-grade students from one 20-minute recess a day to four 15-minute recesses — or an hour, total —it found that students were more focused in class and that teachers were able to move through curricular material faster. Off-task behaviors in class decreased by 25 to 35 percent and students’ body mass indexes (weight divided by height) stabilized or decreased, said Deborah Rhea, a professor at Texas Christian University and the lead researcher on the longer-recess initiative. We’re at least getting closer to a healthy environment that’s conducive to learning for teachers and for kids, Rhea said of the multiple 15-minute breaks. All of this research comes after nearly three decades of school policies that decreased recess time amidst fears that the unstructured time led to student fights or took time away from students’ focus on passing standardized tests. One 2007 survey by George Washington University found that 20 percent of a representative sample of districts had decreased recess time by an average of 50 minutes a week and 9 percent had reduced physical education time by an average of 40 minutes."
EDUCATION,Texas District Says Students Protesting Gun Violence Will Get Suspended,"The superintendent of a Houston-area school district threatened students with three-day suspensions if they participate in gun violence protests during school hours. Student-led protests and walkouts have erupted across the country in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead. Participants have focused their energy on demanding lawmakers take action against gun violence. But Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of Needville Independent School District, warned students that they would face consequences for participating in such demonstrations. Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness!! Rhodes wrote in a statement posted Tuesday to Needville High School’s Facebook page. Should students choose to do so, they will be suspended from school for 3 days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension. Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative, he wrote. We will discipline no matter if it is one, fifty, or five hundred students involved. Amanda Johnson, a volunteer with the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, accused Rhodes of fear-mongering and creating a missed opportunity. I can’t believe that the superintendent, instead of cooperating with the students, is threatening them the way that he is, she said. School shootings are far more disruptive than a school walkout. School officials at one high school in Hollywood, Florida, roughly 30 miles to the south of Stoneman Douglas, told students there would consequences if they participated in a walkout on Wednesday.  Ben Gamla Preparatory Academy Principal Gayle Iacono later agreed to let students protest for 17 minutes at noon in the school parking lot. But when students began the demonstration, they found the school’s entry gates were locked, preventing them from leaving the school grounds. Students who jumped the fence to protest in front of the school were led back to class by school security personnel, according to local ABC affiliate WPLG-TV. Representatives for the Needville district and Ben Gamla Preparatory did not immediately respond to ’s requests for comment. In contrast, some school districts have taken a more supportive approach to the demonstrations. For instance, the Leon County school system in Tallahassee, Florida,  announced that it would excuse students who participated in a rally Wednesday at the state Capitol. Parents ultimately decide whether their children should attend school or participate in an out of school activity, a statement posted to the district’s Facebook page said. These kids have got a very valid concern, Johnson said, noting that her organization’s membership on Facebook had tripled since last week’s shooting. They’re literally in fear for their lives."
EDUCATION,Company That Sells Bulletproof Gucci And Hermès Bags Sees Huge Sales In School Backpacks,"The Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead has triggered a rise in the sales of bulletproof backpacks. On Thursday, one day after former student Nikolas Cruz stormed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and injuring dozens more, Massachusetts-based company Bullet Blocker was inundated with orders for bulletproof backpacks, comprising a 30 percent spike in sales. The concept for the company originated in 1999 by father of two Joe Curran, a self-described helicopter dad and former U.S. Army Ranger in Lowell, Mass. Curran became concerned about school security after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., during which teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 students and injured 20 others. But would be eight years and three more school shootings before Curran had the resources to go into business. Virginia Tech was the final straw for me, he tells Yahoo Lifestyle, referring to Virginia Polytechnic student Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on the Blacksburg, Va., campus before committing suicide in 2007. I started asking local schools for their security plans in the event of armed intruders and there weren’t any concrete plans, so I wanted to promote the idea of kids protecting themselves. Bullet Blocker sells 11 backpacks, ranging in price from $210 to $490, including My Child’s Pack, a $199 sack (on sale from $210) weighing 2 pounds and available in pink or blue. The latter looks like a standard school bag but it’s lined with knife-and-bulletproof material called Kevlar that’s approved by the National Institute of Justice, an organization that sets body armor standards for law enforcement. Specifically, the fabric traps and slows down bullets shot from a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum, a 9mm handgun, and a .45 caliber weapon. Recently, a woman in Hollywood, Calif., bought one for every child she knows, and the wife of a New England Patriots player ordered three for each of her children, says Curran. The idea is that kids can hold it up as a shield."
EDUCATION,"While Teachers Fight For Better Pay, West Virginia Lawmakers Discuss Opossums","Teachers in West Virginia are facing a battle over their paychecks as insurance hikes threaten to outpace raises -- leading to a virtual pay cut. As a measure to provide raises for teachers lingers in the state’s House of Delegates, one lawmaker admonished his colleagues for spending more time this week discussing issues relating to turkey breasts, opossums, crows, trout and deer in West Virginia than cries for help from its educators. Ladies and gentlemen, we’re about one-third of the way through this legislative session, Del. Mike Caputo (D) said. We’ve got galleries full of people who are worried about their livelihood, and we spent 20 minutes talking about opossums. On Monday, the West Virginia House passed a bill making it a crime for hunters to waste game by leaving carcasses behind or only taking trophies, such as antlers. Over in the Senate, lawmakers talked about legalizing an unusual method of catfishing called noodling, which involves plunging one’s arms into a stream and hauling a fish to shore after it latches on. We’re talking about 9 million issues that don’t protect the livelihood of the people we should be protecting, Caputo said. Hundreds of teachers from a handful of the state’s southernmost counties skipped work Friday -- closing schools in their districts -- to appear at the state capital in Charleston. They hoped to send a message to lawmakers in the Senate who were voting that day on a bill to provide 1 percent raises for teachers over five years. (Individual districts are free to increase pay further if they so choose.) That comes out to around $400 per year, but critics say it’s not enough to match changes in insurance premiums, slated to go into effect July 1. The outcry led Gov. Jim Justice (R) on Tuesday to ask the Public Employees Insurance Agency, which provides insurance to public school districts, to freeze premiums for the upcoming fiscal year. The move would allow for more input from enrollees and lawmakers on the changes that were originally approved in December. Asked whether this decision changes anything for the state’s teachers, Kym Randolph, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association, had a simple answer: No. They want to kick the can down the road so they don’t have to make a tough decision in an election year, Randolph said. Lawmakers aren’t going far enough to provide teachers the pay raises they need to stay competitive, she added, especially considering how many teachers can simply drive across state lines to find better paying jobs. West Virginia has been ranked 48th in average teacher pay, according to the National Education Association. (The national average teacher salary was $58,353 in 2016; West Virginia’s average stood at $45,622.) Their priorities are all over the place. If this were really a priority, they’d find money for it, Randolph said. They can find money for other things, she said, like giving taxes back to businesses. You still have to prioritize schools and state employees, she said. Despite teachers’ efforts, the Senate passed the measure 33-0, sending it on to the state’s House of Delegates. The benefit increases and coverage reductions are way more expensive than the amount of the raise, sixth grade math teacher Violet Cohenour told WOWK. So it’s kind of a slap in the face to say that they’re giving us a raise, because that’s not the case. The 1 percent proposal would also mean West Virginia would miss a goal it set back in 2014: to pay new teachers with bachelor’s degrees at least $43,000 annually by 2019. The state’s current starting salary for new teachers with degrees is $33,000, according to local news outlets. Advocates for the 1 percent raises say the bill is fiscally responsible. We all know that’s not enough, Sen. Sue Cline (R) told the West Virginia Gazette-Mail. I’m personally so tired of hearing about how hardhearted I am, how mean I am. "
EDUCATION,"Homeless Students, Destroyed Campuses, ‘Invisible Injuries’: What California Schools Learned From Recent Disasters","California schools ravaged by fire, floods and mud this year have mostly re-opened and are diving in to a new semester, but district leaders say they’ve learned some crucial lessons about handling natural disasters that all schools could benefit from. A disaster could happen anywhere at any time in California, said Steven Herrington, superintendent of the Sonoma County Office of Education, where two public schools were destroyed, nearly a dozen schools were damaged and hundreds of students and staff lost their homes. We all have emergency plans. For us, overall, things went pretty smoothly. But nothing can really prepare you for a major disaster like what we experienced. California suffered a historic wildfire season in 2017, and began 2018 with devastating mudslides in Santa Barbara County. In October, fires ripped through Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties in the Wine Country, killing 44 and destroying thousands of buildings; in early December, a swarm of fires scorched Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties in Southern California (one of the fires, the Thomas Fire, was the largest wildfire in state history). On Jan. 9, mudslides and floods swept through Montecito in Santa Barbara County, killing 21 and destroying 115 homes. School leaders in those areas say they had very little notice of the impending disasters and had to troubleshoot an enormous, and often shifting, set of variables under highly stressful circumstances — in some cases as their own families and homes were imperiled. Herrington’s wife, for example, was undergoing cancer treatment at a local hospital when the fires erupted. The immediate priority was the safety of students and staff, but the weeks following the disasters were spent assessing damage to school buildings, finding alternative campuses, arranging repairs, handling claims paperwork, tending to students’ emotional well-being and trying to predict enrollment figures as hundreds of students and staff suddenly became homeless. Meanwhile, some students missed weeks of instruction due to closed schools — meaning the school year will extend later into the summer, breaks will be canceled and students will need waivers for college applications, advanced placement tests and standardized exams. It took Lake County schools two years to recover from their fire (in 2015). We anticipate the same here, Herrington said. But I think overall, people here are very optimistic. We’re really trying to keep positive and deal with each challenge as it comes along. The California Department of Education allows schools to continue receiving their usual per-pupil funding in cases of natural disasters, and provides extensive resources to help schools cope with the array of challenges. In addition, the federal McKinney-Vento Act provides rights to homeless students — including those who lost their homes in disasters — such as the right to continue attending their original school regardless of where they’re living. In Ventura County, County Superintendent Stan Mantooth said that even though local schools had done regular emergency drills, nothing could prepare students and staff for the fire that tore through their picturesque, coastal county in early December. It was absolutely surreal, he said. We thought we were going to be OK but then the wind shifted and we suddenly had a wall of smoke coming at us, like a fog bank. You see things like this on TV but it’s not the same when you’re right there, looking at a whole mountain on fire. Ventura County did not lose any schools, but flames came within feet of some campuses, and many schools suffered severe smoke damage. In Ventura Unified, 100 fewer students showed up for school after the fires. In Santa Paula, in the rural central part of the county, a mobile home park across from Briggs Elementary burned to the ground, displacing dozens of mostly immigrant families. We’re still in recovery mode, Mantooth said, noting that he sometimes imagines he smells smoke, long after the fires have extinguished. I’ll be walking around and suddenly smell a campfire — I don’t think it’s real, but the mental residue is very much still there. In Santa Barbara County, the fires and mudslides are among the worst disasters in county history. Nineteen of the county’s 20 school districts were closed in early December due to poor air quality and fire damage, and a month later two schools closed again due to the mudslides. Emotions have ranged from fear and frustration to relief and exuberance — especially when children, parents and teachers reunited following a school closure, said county Office of Education spokesman David Lawrence. There are stories of incredible heroism — what the first responders encountered and what residents experienced was just extraordinary. And to see the excitement of kids when they get back together, that’s an emotional and heart-warming thing, he said. But some people are still shaken … Given the gravity of what happened, one thing we’re watching closely is ‘invisible’ injuries — emotional reactions that aren’t immediately obvious. Herrington’s office has shared what they learned with their counterparts in Southern California, as well as the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the University of Southern California. Researchers there study school disasters nationwide, from hurricanes to mass shootings to terrorist attacks, and have compiled resources for schools and students who might be experiencing grief. Dr. David Schonfeld, the center’s director, said that during disasters schools can become an important center of the community, especially for immigrant families. In this political climate, a lot of immigrant families are extremely reluctant to seek services from government agencies, but they trust their child’s teacher, or principal, so school is the only place they’ll go, he said. School might also be the only source of stability in a child’s life for a while, he said."
EDUCATION,Columbia University Refuses To Recognize Graduate Student Union,"Columbia University’s graduate students voted overwhelmingly to unionize in late 2016, in an election certified by the federal government. But as far as the Ivy League school’s administration is concerned, the whole union thing was just a grad student fantasy -- one that President Donald Trump may help dissipate. In a letter Tuesday, Provost John H. Coatsworth told the school community that Columbia does not recognize the union’s legitimacy and intends to fight it in court. The school has dragged its feet on bargaining with the union, and Coatsworth’s letter makes clear Columbia will take the fight as far as it can, regardless of any damage the university’s reputation may suffer. Coatsworth acknowledged the decision to challenge the union wouldn’t be a popular one among students and alumni. We recognize the potential, indeed the likelihood, for disappointment and dispute in our community, he wrote. Needless to say, we have not come to this decision lightly. Because of the principles at stake -- principles essential to the university’s mission of training scholars -- we have declined to bargain until the legal process has been allowed to run its course. Coatsworth said the school will ask a federal appellate court to review the dispute. Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board -- which paved the way for the union -- could come to the school’s rescue under Trump. Indeed, Columbia and other supposedly liberal schools fighting grad student campaigns -- the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and Cornell University among them -- find themselves in the awkward position of hoping the Trump administration will deliver for them. The NLRB -- in one of its biggest decisions in years -- decided in August 2016 that Columbia graduate students were, in fact, employees of the school, and therefore eligible to unionize. The board determined that it didn’t matter whether the graduate students were there to be educated, as Columbia stressed -- they were paid to do work, which made them employees. That decision set up the grad-student vote to join the United Auto Workers. And it opened the door for grad students who teach at other private schools to exert their collective bargaining rights. But the union movement was dealt a major setback with Trump’s election. The president gets to fill open slots on the five-member NLRB, which referees disputes between employers and unions in the private sector. It was a liberal majority that decided the Columbia case in favor of the graduate students. A conservative majority is more likely to side with the schools and determine that grad students are ineligible to unionize. The board is currently split 2-2 along partisan lines due to the expiration of one member’s term. Once Trump names a fifth member and the Senate approves his pick, a full board may well revive the grad student question and rule instead against the right to unionize. It isn’t uncommon for the board to reverse precedent in a matter of years. In fact, the 2016 Columbia decision had overturned a 2004 ruling against grad students."
EDUCATION,What Common Core Won,"I’ve said often that the Common Core failed in its creators’ central goal -- to establish a set of national standards followed with fidelity by every school from Maine to Alaska. Every school would follow the exact same set of learning goals so that a child who left Iowa to attend school in Florida could make the switch without missing a step. The standards would be set in cement (remember the rule that a state could only add 15 percent additional Stuff) and we would all march together in lockstep into a fully-standardized perfect education future. But the Core was revealed as both political kryptonite and amateur-hour educational junk. It entered the Bad Policy Witness Protection Program and took up residence in many states under an assumed name. Also, states took about five minutes to realize they could go ahead and rewrite, alter and add anything they damn well felt like. Now the goal is standards-based curriculum. Instead of curriculum conversations that begin with What do we believe a graduate of our school district should know? we now get conversations that begin with Let’s take a look at the standards. And then schools use them as a checklist. Let’s work our way down the list of standards and make sure that we have something written into the curriculum that allows us to check off each one so that we can say it’s covered. And let’s be double-certain when it comes to the tested standards. Here are the questions that are not answered (and sometimes not asked) in attempts to build standards-based curriculum: Where did these standards come from? Who wrote them, and is there some reason to believe that they know better than our own trained professionals what students in our district should learn? Are the standards based on any sort of research, and is that research valid and trustworthy? What is not covered by the standards? Are the standards strictly focused on skills while ignoring content (spoiler alert: probably)? Are there areas of our course of study that we, in our considered professional judgment, consider vital, but which the standards do not address? And if there are are, given a finite school year, can we discuss setting aside some of the standards in order to make room for content and material that we consider important? When the Common Core wave passed, it had swept away the notion that actual teachers and administrators are experts in education. Teaching, it turns out, is somehow too hard for mere teachers. Instead, the standards-based school district now assumes that nobody in the school system actually knows what should be taught, and that the most they can be trusted with is to unpack the standards and create a checklist-certified list of education activities that will meet the standards’ demands. That’s the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the district doesn’t believe that trained education professionals can be trusted with even that much, and should just be handed materials that dictate the teacher’s every move, throwing aside their professional judgment and replacing it with the judgment of some bureaucrat or textbook publisher. Worst of all for the long run, this approach has infected schools of education who prepare their few remaining future teachers to accept this, to envision for themselves a diminished role as content delivery specialists or instructional facilitators or classroom coaches. Common Core was pitched against a definite enemy-- the teachers who insisted in teaching things in their own classroom just because they thought those things were worth teaching, the teacher who insisted on using her own professional judgment, the teacher who wanted to function as an autonomous individual. Ironically, even though the Common Core did not conquer the nation’s school districts as it had hoped, it did manage to deliver a serious defeat to its chosen enemy.  We now understand in (too many) districts that we must adhere to the Standards, which have descended manna-like from some mysterious, magical higher power. They are not to be argued with or contradicted, nor will there be any discussion of the educational wisdom (or lack thereof) behind them. They are to be treated as our compass, our grail, our North Star. Teachers should sit down, shut up, and start aligning. And that defeat of professional educators, that clampdown on teacher autonomy-- that’s the one victory that Common Core State (sic) Standards can claim."
EDUCATION,Texas Schools Illegally Excluded Students With Disabilities: Federal Officials,"Texas education officials violated federal law when they excluded more than 100,000 students with disabilities from programs designed to help them, the federal government announced. The Department of Education sent a letter to the Texas Education Agency Thursday to announce it’s findings after a 15-month-long investigation. The federal government found that state officials were setting a target for how many students could receive special education services, The New York Times reported. Federal law insists that school serve all students with disabilities. The state’s target created a drop of more than 100,000 students who were previously getting the tools the needed, including therapy and counseling. As the Times explains The law requires that schools base their special ed decisions on need, not opinion, or space availability, or money, or teacher training or other subjective positions, Kerry Steiner, who worked with a Texas school district as part of a parent training project, told the publication at the time. It was heartbreaking to see schools not do that. Federal investigators held public forums, went to school districts across the state, and interviewed teachers before coming to their conclusion. The DOE has now ordered Texas to create a plan to find and help students who were illegally kept out from special education programs. Every child with a disability must have appropriate access to special education and related services that meet his or her unique needs, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. Far too many students in Texas had been precluded from receiving supports and services. Texas lawmakers had previously ended the policy following the Houston Chronicle’s report."
EDUCATION,Children Forced To 'Deal With It' And Bundle Up As Classrooms Lose Heat,"When social studies teacher Jesse Schneiderman arrived at school after the holiday break on Tuesday, he found a dangerous environment waiting for his students. Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore was in shambles. Pipes that had just been turned back on had burst, leaving some rooms flooded. Heating vents weren’t working. Entire rooms were destroyed and inaccessible. Plus, it was bitterly cold. Schneiderman told  that temperatures inside the school building were in the 30s when he arrived, and still in the 40s on Wednesday. Photos on Twitter showed students across the city suffering as a result. It felt like a disaster movie, Schneiderman said. You had a lot of kids who were wearing hats and coats and gloves in classes. Infrastructure problems were compounded by a storm front that’s already bringing snow, freezing temperatures and heavy winds to the East Coast. The weather is supposed to get worse Wednesday night and through Thursday. Baltimore City Public Schools acknowledged the problems at Frederick Douglass High School and others across the city and closed them down on Tuesday and Wednesday, though Schneiderman said that decision was too late. We have many schools with leaky windows and outdated heating systems that have a hard time keeping up, city schools spokeswoman Edie House-Foster told The Baltimore Sun. With extreme temperatures, we have the added challenge of freezing pipes and water main breaks."
EDUCATION,New Mexico Charter School CEO Steals Public Money For 15 Years. How’s That For Oversight?,"On Dec. 23, 2017, KOB.com (Albuquerque) published an article concerning the survival of the Southwest Aeronautics Mathematics and Science Academy (SAMS), one of a group of New Mexico charter schools that suffered the effects of massive fraud perpetrated by its founder/ administrator, David Scott Glasrud, over a 15-year period (2000-2014). Glasrud founded the first school, Southwest Secondary Learning Center, in December 1999. He later opened an additional three schools, including SAMS. According to his own admission, within a year, Glasrud devised and executed a scheme to defraud, and as the U.S. Attorney’s Office continues in its case against Glasrud, he misrepresented, concealed, and omitted material facts, and breached duties that he owed to the schools as an administrator and employee. Now, here’s the rub in this supposed age of greater accountability for greater autonomy of charter schools: On Dec. 22, 2014, the chief of staff of the State of New Mexico Office of the State Auditor sent a pointed, scathing letter to New Mexico Public Education Department (NMPED) deputy secretary of finance and operations, Hipolito (Paul) Aguilar, for failing to adequately audit Glasrud in a timely, competent manner in the first place (instead of attempting to bypass the state auditor and scrambling in August 2014 – when the FBI began investigating Glasrud – to patch together some means of damage control). The state auditor’s letter dated Dec. 22, 2014, is the last in a series of 33 pages of correspondence between the auditor and NMPED regarding Glasrud. Surely NMPED should answer for its ineptness. To date, there is no direct evidence that NMPED has itself been held accountable – which makes it seem that other Glasruds could be living large on public money supposedly overseen by NMPED. In March 2015, Aguilar applied for the position of Albuquerque school superintendent but did not get the job. In March 2016, three NMPED officers resigned. Aguilar was rumored to be resigning, but he did not and remains in his position with PED as of this writing. Hanna Skandera is no longer New Mexico education commissioner. In June 2017, New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez announced Skandera’s resignation. It is not clear whether Skandera’s exit is connected with NMPED’s lack of charter school oversight. As for Glasrud: As of this writing, it seems he has yet to be sentenced. Following his August 2014 resignation, Glasrud taught special education at Bloomfield High School (New Mexico) (August 2016 to October 2017). Bloomfield High School now posts Glasrud’s position as vacant. However, his Linkedin bio makes it appear that he continues to teach at Bloomfield High and that his 15 years as a NM charter school CEO simply never happened."
EDUCATION,Newly Reelected New York City Mayor Decides His School Renewal Plan Failed But Still Claims Success,"In 2013, Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York City on a program that included a promise to abandon his predecessor’s policy of closing struggling schools. Instead of closure, a Renewal approach would improve school performance through heavy investment of money and support. Last month de Blasio was reelected Mayor with the same promise. This month his school chancellor, Carmen Fariña, announced the Department of Education would close 14 schools and mysteriously reorganize six others. The schools will be closed or transformed because of a combination of low standardized test scores, enrollment, graduation rates, and attendance, chronic absenteeism, and poor classroom instruction and school leadership. DOE officials insist the school closings are actually part of the initial Renewal School program. Because of his initial promises, de Blasio combined the school-closing announcement with a declaration of success – 21 RISE schools will graduate out of the Renewal program. Yet despite genuine statistical improvement at these schools, their students continue to perform significantly below city averages on standardized test scores. Fariña apparently had enough school success and two days later announced she was retiring. The DOE promises it will work with each student impacted by the changes to ensure they can attend a higher-performing school next school year, but why would anyone believe their educational promises? The DOE, Farina and de Blasio also fail to explain a number of things about the new program. Thirty-six percent of the students at the Coalition School for Social Change in East Harlem are students with disabilities; almost all are Black of Hispanic; and 100 percent are from poor families. The dropout rate is at least 25 percent. The school, which opened in 1993, was one of the first experimental small schools created in an earlier wave of school reform. How will transferring these students to nearby struggling, but slightly higher performing schools, significantly improve their lives and education? Brooklyn Collegiate: A College Board School is another 100 percent minority, 100 percent poor family, school, this time on the border of the Crown Heights and Brownsville sections of Brooklyn. About one-fourth of its students have special needs. In November, the New York Times reported that its four-year graduation rate had fallen while it was in the renewal program. Graduation rates also fell at New Explorers High School, High School for Health Careers and Sciences, and Holcombe L. Rucker School of Community, other schools that are being axed. All of these schools were created during earlier school reorganization plans under previous mayoral administrations. How is this reform any different? About one-third of the 1.1 children and teens that attend New York City schools live in poverty. Over one hundred thousand were homeless at some point during the 2016-2017 school year. Ten percent of its registered students live on the street, in cars, in shelters, in abandoned buildings, in public housing double-ups, and in over-crowded deteriorating tenements with people they do not know. They often don’t have basic food, clothing, and health care, or heat in the freezing winter and air-conditioning in the sweltering summer. Over 60 percent are chronically absent from school. Closing schools does nothing to change the conditions of their lives. Past school closings have led to a cascading of school failure. The best example is A Train corridor schools in Queens. Far Rockaway High School was at the southeast terminal of the A train. A two-hour subway ride from Manhattan, drawing students from a community of high-rise public housing and crumbling former beach bungalows, with a large recent immigrant population, students who did not speak English and whose education was interrupted in the former country, Far Rockaway was zoned for failure. It stopped accepting students in 2008 and closed in 2011. When Far Rockaway closed, students from the area were sent a short subway ride away to nearby Beach Channel High School. When Beach Channel failed, students now traveled along the A train corridor to John Adams and Richmond Hill. Soon those schools were in trouble as well. There is no question that the schools slated for closing fail children. But at some point New York City, state, and national education officials must be forced to recognize that reshuffling the deck is not school reform or a program to improve the lives of students and their families."
EDUCATION,'Sesame Street' Wins $100 Million Grant To Create Programming For Refugee Children,"The nonprofit organization behind Sesame Street has been awarded a $100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation, the largest of its kind, to create programming for children displaced by Syria’s civil war. Sesame Workshop, in partnership with International Rescue Committee, was selected for the foundation’s coveted 100&Change grant on Wednesday for a proposal to bring early education programming to refugee children. The effort promises to create a scalable, measurable model that can be replicated to educate refugee children around the world. Our early childhood development program will be the largest in the history of humanitarian response, bringing hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children, Sesame Workshop says on its website. The organization has already started a pilot program in Jordan and will now begin work to replicate its model on a global scale. According to the Chicago Tribune, the MacArthur Foundation contest was announced in June 2016 and called for proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location. Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee will focus their efforts on children located in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. According to UNICEF, countries surrounding Syria are hosting more than 5.3 million registered Syrian refugees, including more than 2.5 million children. Many refugee children are not enrolled in any school. We are compelled to respond to the urgent Syrian refugee crisis by supporting what will be the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting, Julia Stasch, the MacArthur Foundation president, said in a press release. Less than 2 percent of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children, Stasch continued. The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education. The program will include a customized, local version of TV show Sesame Street, home visits with caregiving support sessions, and the creation of child development community centers."
EDUCATION,New DeVos Loan Forgiveness Plan: Another Assault On Students And Gift To Predatory Schools,"It took Betsy DeVos nearly a year to take any action on the nearly 100,000 applications by former students who assert that they were deceived and abused by predatory for-profit colleges like Corinthian, ITT and Kaplan. But the new process announced today appears to be a step backwards, a new attack on students, and a gift to the most abusive predatory schools. In addition to denying thousands of claims today, DeVos outlined new standards that rip off injured students by limiting their debt relief through weighing of their income, often even if they have only a low-wage, part-time job, and even if that job has nothing to do with the training they received at the offending college. It’s somewhat unclear from department statements and media reports exactly how the comparisons will be made, but it appears the new approach would punish those students who have overcome the obstacles of a deceptive, subpar education and found a way to support themselves. Or it could penalize the financially worst-off graduates of a career education program at a failed school if others in that program did better. Worse, to limit student debt relief, the department is using income data derived from the Obama gainful employment rule -- the same data that the department, at the urging of for-profit college lobbyists, appears ready to abandon when measuring the performance of schools. In other words, data that shows career college students tend to earn low incomes is used by DeVos when it helps her limit debt relief for students, but is trashed by DeVos when it puts at risk the profits of predatory for-profit colleges. But what the department has announced is even worse than that because Even full cancellation of federal loans would not come close to making students whole from their experience of attending a dishonest school, because of all the out-of-pocket expenditures, grants, scholarships, earned benefits, expensive private loans, time and effort that the student expended and that would not be recovered; in light of those non-recoverable costs for students, the new stingy standard is even more harsh. The relief standards are not nearly high enough to deter bad colleges from staying in the federal student aid program and, more importantly, they’re not high enough to deter the department from keeping bad colleges in the program. Thus the new DeVos policy of limiting loan relief for defrauded students is in fact a permissive approach to waste, fraud and abuse that will, over the long term, not save taxpayers money but instead will cost billions. Students have rightly taken action today to file a class action lawsuit against DeVos for denying them the relief to which they are fully entitled. DeVos was supposed to make her first appearance as Secretary today before the House Education and the Workforce Committee. But that appearance -- her only scheduled appearance before the committee for 2017 -- was inexplicably cancelled.  The committee chairwoman, Virginia Foxx -- a relentless supporter of the for-profit college industry -- claims as her committee motto Keeping Washington Accountable. Hardly."
EDUCATION,Hungry on Campus,"When the federal government created the National School Lunch Program in 1946, it was viewed at the time as a national security initiative. Undernourished students, after all, would likely not be fit enough to serve in the armed forces. But it was also described more broadly as strengthening the nation as a whole. We have the technical knowledge to provide plenty of good food for every man, woman and child in this country, President Harry Truman said when he signed the act into law. Despite our capacity to produce food, we have often failed to distribute it as well as we should. The program, Truman said, was a step forward in correcting this national failure. In the decades since, progress has been made in ensuring our students no longer go hungry, but there is still much work to be done. Student hunger does not end at high school graduation. Food insecurity is plaguing our college campuses, with thousands of students each year skipping meals, going to bed hungry and suffering in class. It’s a crisis that warrants federal intervention at a level similar to the National School Lunch Program. Yet, little is being done to address the issue. A recent Brookings Institution study found that food insecurity among households with students in four-year colleges in 2015 was 11.2 percent. Households with students who enrolled in two-year colleges were more likely to be food insecure, with average rates of food insecurity of 21.2 percent during 2008-14. A 2015 study at California State University estimated that food insecurity affected an alarming 21 percent of students. Feeding America, a national nonprofit network of food banks, estimates that nearly half of the college students who use its pantries each year must choose between paying for educational expenses and food. According to the University of Wisconsin HOPE Lab, undergraduate students are at greater risk for food insecurity than the general population. Earlier this year, researchers at the lab surveyed 33,000 community college students across the country. They discovered that one-third of those students are going hungry.  The concept of the starving college student is too easily dismissed, thanks to long-standing caricatures of campus life. All college students eat ramen noodles, so what’s the big deal? True hunger and food insecurity is no joke, however. As Brookings noted, food insecurity among college students is associated with poorer health, poor academic performance, and mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety.  Colleges are trying to help. Amherst College, for example, has gone so far as to open a year-round dorm so that housing- and food-insecure students have a place to stay and get food during times when the normal dorms are closed. Last year, California passed legislation that requires its public colleges to apply to participate in local food assistance programs. It also established funding for college food pantries as part of the state’s Emergency Food Assistance Program. Many institutions have opened up such food pantries in recent years. Nearly 400 schools are now part of the College and University Food Bank Alliance. Four years ago, the organization had just 15 members. One member, George Washington University, opened its food bank last year. Within a month, more than 250 students were using the pantry each day. Colleges have had to step up, not only to address the immense needs of their students, but because little help is coming from anywhere else. As a country, we are ignoring the problem. The systems currently in place for keeping Americans from starving do not translate well to college campuses. While a growing number of college students are enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the vast majority cannot use those benefits on campus. As of 2016, just two college campuses were known to have cleared the many hurdles that prevent colleges from participating the program. At a minimum, the federal government should require the states to track graduation rates for food insecure students. Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University and a leading expert on student hunger, has proposed extending the National School Lunch Program from schoolchildren to college students, and extending subsidized housing and transportation to college students. But this is hardly enough. Many food insecure students are also homeless. The University of Wisconsin study found that 14 percent of community college students are currently experienced homelessness. They require counseling, shelter, and often clothing subsidies and emergency funds."
EDUCATION,How One California School District Is Leading The Way On New Science Standards,"By devoting thousands of hours to teacher training, the district has shown teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade how to explain a scientific phenomenon in a new way to their students — by letting the students discover the answers on their own, instead of memorizing facts from a textbook. We feel science is the center of a good education, so this has been a priority for us from the beginning. But there are fundamental things we’ve done that all districts can do, said Amy Argento, one of three classroom science teachers the district assigned to train their colleagues. What we’ve done is replicable anywhere. Any district can do this. Torrance is an ethnically mixed, middle class city of 145,000 a little over 20 miles south of Los Angeles. Twenty-five percent of the students in its public schools qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and 16 percent are English learners.   About 29 percent are Latino, 29 percent are Asian,  22 percent are white, 8 percent are Filipino and 4 percent are African American. The new standards, called Next Generation Science Standards, were introduced nationally in 2013, in response to concerns among science educators, political leaders and many others that K-12 science instruction in the United States trails behind many other industrialized countries. So far, 19 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, California was among the first. Stressing hands-on projects and critical thinking, the new standards represent a significant shift for most teachers — not just a change in subject matter, but to a new way of teaching, with less emphasis on textbooks and classroom lectures and more on open-ended scientific inquiry. That shift has required additional professional learning for even the most veteran teachers. Districts across California are preparing teachers now, either by sending them to off-site seminars, sitting in on colleagues’ classrooms or going to multi-day workshops over summer or school breaks. At the trainings, teachers learn the standards’ core ideas, such as cause and effect or relationships in ecosystems, which are incorporated into all grade levels, as well as practical tips such as how to make lesson plans and oversee regular science experiments in class. The goal is for students to understand the broad scientific concepts that link all scientific disciplines and to learn those concepts through hands-on classroom projects. In California, all students are expected to be taught using the new standards by spring 2019, when schools will administer standardized tests based on the new standards.   Students in some grades have already begun taking a pilot version of the test. Torrance’s jumpstart began with a handful of science teachers, who were impressed with how the new standards focused on doing science, not just listening to a teacher talk about it, said Marissa Stillittano, a former classroom teacher who’s now one of the district’s Next Generation Science Standards trainers. California had not updated its science standards since 1998, and some states hadn’t revised theirs since the 1980s. The new standards include recent scientific research breakthroughs as well as technology and engineering components, which were lacking in the previous standards. There hadn’t been a lot of attention given to science education until Next Generation came along, Stillittano said. To see this national focus on science education and everything it could be was just very exciting, a chance to clean the slate. It was like, ‘OK, we can get this right.’  Stillittano, Argento, colleague Tera Black and other science teachers pushed the district to get an early start on training. The district agreed to fund two new positions to oversee the training and pay for substitutes so teachers could attend training throughout the year. Stillittano, Argento and Black started by learning the new standards themselves, then began organizing trainings in the district. They hold several trainings a week for small groups of teachers, divided by grade or subject matter. They try to keep the trainings focused and practical, encouraging teachers to collaborate, share curriculum ideas and resources, such as beakers, scales and microscopes for classroom science projects. They also give teachers materials they’ll need for classroom projects, such as balloons or baking soda, and give teachers tips on how to share supplies and where to buy materials at the lowest prices. But the most important aspect, they said, is the element of fun — the same thing that makes the new standards so popular with students. To help colleagues feel welcome and relaxed, Argento, Stillittano and Black wear matching outfits (during one recent training, all three wore black dresses and yellow sweaters), bring baked goods and lead the teachers in the same science experiments they’ll be overseeing in their classrooms during the school year. That means teachers make their own topographical maps of California using homemade play dough, or go outside to learn about energy transference by tossing dried pinto beans at each other. You don’t learn swimming by reading a book. You jump in the pool. So we jumped in the pool, said Katie Schenkelberg, a former science teacher and current principal at Carr Elementary, who was among the original teachers who championed the new standards. There are also evening sessions for parents to learn about the new standards, and trainings for other districts as well. In a 5th grade classroom at Towers Elementary, the new standards were in full swing on a recent Wednesday afternoon. Students were learning about properties of matter by dragging Q-tips soaked in iodine across Russet potato slices. One student, Gavin Ashley, dropped his jaw and gasped when his potato turned from creamy white to ashy gray. I was not expecting that! he said, scribbling his observations in a notebook. I thought it would turn orange, the same color as the iodine. … I like how in science there’s so many different things you can try. It’s not boring. Torrance Unified has drawn the attention of the nation’s science education leaders, who praised the district’s efforts to fully implement Next Generation Science Standards ahead of schedule and on a limited budget. I haven’t heard of another district of that size that has completed multiple trainings for all of their teachers, said Chad Colby, spokesperson for Achieve, an education research nonprofit that helped craft the standards. Torrance Unified — the educators, school leaders, the superintendent and school board — should be commended for making science education a priority. Torrance is not the only district to get a jumpstart on the new standards. Elsewhere in California, eight other districts and two charter organizations are part of an early implementer program overseen by WestEd, the research and consulting firm headquartered in San Francisco, but Torrance has made its advances on its own. What sets Torrance apart is that, I far as I know, they did it without major grants or outside funding, said Kathy DiRanna, statewide director of WestEd’s K-12 Alliance, which provides professional development workshops to  science teachers. I know they have a dedicated group of science leaders that have helped pave the way. They are to be commended for the advancements that they have made. Although all students are now learning the new standards and nearly all teachers have undergone multiple trainings, the process is not complete, said Ramona Chang, the district’s curriculum director. Because science is always changing and teaching techniques constantly evolve, professional development — especially related to something as nuanced as the Next Generation Science Standards — should be ongoing, she said."
EDUCATION,Want To Start School Later? Avoid These 10 Common Traps,"It’s no secret that most middle and high schools start too early in the morning. Research has been clear on this for decades. Major health groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association have issued calls to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Schools following their advice find that more students get more sleep—and less substance use, depression, absenteeism, truancy and even car crashes. People change their minds and their behaviors primarily on the basis of their emotion and their pocketbooks—not reason and evidence. This is why deluging school officials with research rarely convinces them, or anyone, that schools need to start later. Having evidence in your pocket is necessary, but it is not enough by itself to get a community to delay bell times. There’s good research everywhere. But it doesn’t mean anything if it isn’t read, heard and accepted. For research to matter, it needs to come from a trusted authority. In this case, that usually means means school leaders themselves have to provide and defend it, and explain why they believe this change is the right thing to do. Educational materials about sleep and the impact of early school start times issued by school districts have much more impact on parents and teachers than materials from a Nobel Prize winner. Many parents working for later start times insist that their superintendent fully supports a change. Perhaps they were given personal assurances. Perhaps the superintendent even formed a study group to look at the issue. Unfortunately, talk is cheap. There is a huge difference between supporting the idea of a later start time and supporting a specific start time change for your district. This is not surprising. When things get real, the trade-offs and negatives come to light. So do the precise ways the new schedule differs from the current one, which means change. And change is always hard, even good change. And so we do nothing, sacrificing the good (or the better) schedule for the perfect. Successful districts often avoid announcing specific time changes, or even a selection of possibilities, until well into the change process. Instead, they start by setting a goal such as no middle or high school classes before 8:30 a.m., no student of any age will be required to attend class before 8 a.m. or the first bus pick-up shall not be before 7 a.m. Once a community accepts the goal, they can move from should we do this? to how will we do this? Believe it or not, that is biggest hurdle of all! Community life revolves around school schedules. So it is no wonder that many community members worry about how any changes to school hours will impact things like work schedules, daycare, extracurricular activities, traffic and so forth. They also worry about how much such a change will cost. We know from the many districts that have delayed bell times that most of these concerns never materialize. Others are temporary and resolvable. Responding to these concerns before the community is committed to later start times will only mean wasted time fighting futile and irrelevant battles. The time to address concerns is after a community has committed itself to healthy start times and is refining potential options. Many successful districts say getting consensus from a broad group of community stakeholders was a vital step early in the change process. Having school administrators, teachers, staff, health professionals, athletic directors, bus drivers, parents, and students hash out ideas together can help identify potential problems and concerns and generate viable options for consideration by the larger community. Many districts poll communities about changing schedules. This can be a great way to identify potential concerns. But offering no change as an option is a great way to kill change of any sort. Our natural status quo bias leads us overestimate the cost of any change while overlooking the cost of keeping things the way they are. Assuming the district has already set a goal of starting school later, keeping the status quo has to be off the table. Again, since the goal has been set, the question is no longer whether to change, but how. Time and time again, a district that does not particularly want to change bell times will generate a sky-high figure about the cost of change, usually involving adding new buses. Interestingly, when these estimates are reconsidered by a district committed to the change— sometimes with the help of routing software and always with the help of creative thinking and political will—these numbers often if not always plummet. In fact, there is almost always a no-cost (and sometimes cost-saving) way to start schools at later, healthier times. Finding it just means reassessing priorities. Outreach through flyers, forums, webinars, and face-to face meetings are essential to help community members understand why changes are being made as well as to provide reassurance and find ways to mitigate or address negative or unforeseen impacts. Ideally this outreach occurs before details about new schedules are announced. Cherry Creek, Colorado schools spent over 18 months meeting with stakeholder groups, conducting focus groups, and surveying parents, teachers, and students to pinpoint concerns. They used input from these groups to refine final schedules, compromising to address legitimate concerns. Only then was the time right for a public announcement. Change almost always brings temporary logistical challenges and sometimes unanticipated consequences. Communities need time to rearrange their schedules to address these before implementing a new schedule. In Southern Maine, for example, school leaders left enough time for schools to partner with local parks and recreation departments to create affordable before- and after-care options. Athletic directors had time to devise creative ways to reschedule games to reduce the impact of traveling long distances. School officials had time to develop flexible drop-off times for working parents. Many districts say they would love to run schools at later, healthier times but that they have special constrictions that make change impossible. They say they are too big or too small, too rich or too poor, too urban or too rural, too focused on sports, too diverse, too homogenous, etc. The reality is that districts of all shapes and sizes, all over the country and the world, have found ways to run at safe, healthy hours. While none of these ways is identical, each of them shares one critical element: they regard start times that allow students to get healthy sleep to be critical."
EDUCATION,"To Rewrite Obama Rules, DeVos Picks People Tied To Predatory Colleges","After Betsy DeVos announced she was dumping the Obama gainful employment and borrower defense rules -- measures designed to protect students and taxpayers against predatory abuses by for-profit colleges -- and was starting a new round of rule-making, there was evidence that she was stacking the deck. Her Department of Education issued completely one-sided issue papers around which the sessions would be framed. The department’s chief negotiator for the meetings made a legally dubious announcement that the borrower defense discussions would start from a baseline of a 1994 law, rather than the 2016 Obama final rule. And the department persistently refused to allow members of the public to livestream the proceedings. There was also the DeVos department’s striking announcement that it would include not only the traditional two representatives of for-profit colleges to be on the panels of stakeholders charged with trying to negotiate new rules. Instead, there would be four designated representatives of for-profit colleges on each of the borrower defense and gainful employment panels. But as the rule-making process has unfolded in the past few weeks, it has become apparent that there are, in fact, many more than four for-profit college industry representatives around the table. Worse, some of these negotiators are associated with schools that have particularly troubling records, the kinds of schools whose predatory abuses -- deceptive recruiting, high prices, low spending on education, financial recklessness, and barring of lawsuits by injured students -- were imperiled by the very Obama rules that the negotiators are now empowered to throw away. DeVos is letting the foxes draft rules for the henhouse. Perhaps we couldn’t expect otherwise from a Secretary of Education selected by the founder of predatory Trump University."
EDUCATION,"DeVos Stands With Scoundrels, Not Students -- Part 2","The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the next step in dismantling the rules issued under President Obama to constrain the predatory abuses of for-profit colleges against students and taxpayers. Last month, the department moved toward taking apart the borrower defense rule, which created standards and procedures for students injured by their schools to obtain debt relief. This week, the rule on the chopping block is gainful employment, which established bare minimum measures to penalize schools that consistently leave their students with insurmountable debt. Today, at the end of the troubling first day of what’s called negotiated rulemaking on the gainful employment rule, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak. I was the only one to speak, and I said this This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from well-documented abuses by some career colleges. Blocking the gainful employment rule means that more students will enroll in programs that will ruin their financial futures. These students, as before, will be veterans, single mothers, people of color, immigrants, and the forgotten Americans President Trump promised to fight for. Many will enroll because of false promises about the selectivity of the school, the urgency of enrolling immediately, the cost of attending, transferability of credits, job placement, starting salaries. Many will enroll in programs that aren’t strong enough to help them succeed. Even if these students graduate -- and many don’t -- and even if they get the job they dreamed of -- and many won’t -- they may not earn enough to pay down their loans, because the tuition was just too high. That is the problem the GE rule addressed, implementing a law passed by Congress in 1965. My colleagues and I know hundreds of men and women who are buried in debt from attending dishonest schools, or simply overpriced schools. They’re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos is now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout. The gainful employment rule would save money for taxpayers by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those schools that leave students worse off than when they enrolled. But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting suggest its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. There are many student success stories; I know some of these students, too. Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. The department announced in January that about 800 programs failed the GE test -- less than 10 percent of all GE programs. I’m dismayed that owners whose programs passed or came close to passing GE don’t want to step up and make their programs work, instead of fighting to trash regulations that would put their most unscrupulous, irresponsible competitors -- the ones who have ruined the industry’s reputation -- out of business. This process today is, in reality, about the corruption of our system. It’s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity -- deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And if you don’t do the right thing here, this proceeding will extend and embody that scandal. State attorneys general -- Republicans and Democrats -- will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media, and advocates for students will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors, even if Secretary DeVos continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice, and the wrong side of our people. Keep the existing gainful employment rule. If you do, you will improve the effectiveness, integrity, reputation, and ultimately the success of career colleges, and you will help these students."
EDUCATION,DeVos Department Meeting Again Stalls Over Opposition To Livestreaming,"Last month the Department of Education’s first meeting on rewriting the Obama borrower defense rule for student loans stalled for nearly the whole day over opposition by for-profit colleges and Department representatives to the organization Generation Progress / Higher Ed Not Debt and others livestreaming the meeting. Today, when the department convened a parallel set of meetings to reshape the Obama gainful employment rule, aimed at weeding out career education programs that leave graduates with insurmountable debt, for-profit college negotiators again pressed the Department to halt Generation Progress and its executive director, Maggie Thompson, from livestreaming. In response, advocates for students, public colleges, and state attorneys general pushed back, arguing that there was no basis for barring a live recording of the public meeting. In the end -- see below -- the department backed down, announcing it would not stop the live-stream. Negotiators tied to for-profit colleges had strenuously offered a series of objections to live-streaming. A DeVos department representative, and a facilitator engaged by the department to run the meeting, had agreed, saying that because the department had not given advance notice that the meeting could be livestreamed,  transmission should be barred. The facilitator declared, There will be no livestreaming here. I will describe the back and forth arguments about why live-streaming should or should not be allowed, but the real question is why advocates for for-profit colleges, and the DeVos Department of Education, are so determined to limit public scrutiny of this meeting, while advocates for students want the public to see as much as possible. Kathleen Smith of the department opened today’s meeting by declaring that the Obama rules are insufficiently clear and overly burdensome for some schools. If DeVos and the for-profit schools are so sure it’s just and correct to get rid of these rules aimed at protecting students and taxpayers from predatory college abuses, why not be proud of it, own it, shout it from the rooftops? The for-profit college negotiators repeatedly argued that the meeting could not be live-streamed because the department had not given them notice that it would be. But the department, after initially objecting, acquiesced to live-streaming by members of the public during the 2016 borrower defense meeting, and in last month’s borrower defense meeting the department ultimately committed, in response to the livestreaming debate, to itself create an audio recording of the meetings, and the negotiators never formally voted, and nor did the department formally act, to ban livestreaming. Nor has the department ever purported to order or notify the public that livestreaming was banned generally from negotiated rule-making meetings. Given our nation’s First Amendment commitment to free speech, the presumption must be that a public meeting may be recorded by the public -- written, audio, video. Neal Heller, owner of the Hollywood Institute of Beauty Careers, said he could not understand how any member of the public could be livestreaming the meeting without permission. He expressed concern that a livestream would produce unfair splicing and dicing of the proceedings, and he argued that a better approach would be a professional recording done by the department. But a livestream is in fact the purest form of an unfiltered presentation of the meeting, and even an official recording could be spliced and diced after the fact. Other for-profit college negotiators expressed concern that live-streaming would produce unwanted public commentary on the meeting. Sandy Sarge worried about nasty commentary and negativity by trolls ... in the dark web. Sarge worked for five years at Alta/Westwood, one of the most egregious predatory schools. You don’t need a livestream to know that. Jeff Arthur of for-profit ECPI worried that commentary on social media stemming from the live-stream could make some negotiators uncomfortable. But the fact that the public might comment on a government proceeding should strengthen, not weaken, the case for transmitting it. Jennifer Blum of for-profit Laureate Education, a negotiator representing college lawyers, said she opposed livestreaming because there was no notice and because this is not a public hearing, it’s a negotiation. She worried about a chilling effect on the negotiators. Blum then stated that she had just learned that the event was still being live-streaming as the negotiators debated, leading the meeting facilitator engaged by the department to order that the live-stream be shut down immediately. Thompson defended her right to keep her camera on. The facilitator then shut down the meeting for consultations. The negotiators eventually resumed and debated a proposal that livestreaming go forward, but that if negotiator behavior or public commentary got out of hand, it could revisit the issue."
EDUCATION,"Data, Numbers, Education And Audiences","In fact, the first one is composed entirely of fake data measures, but you weren’t sure, were you. It sounds more official than the second one. Because it’s data, with numbers. The thing is, the second explanation is also packed with data. In fact, it’s the same data, but expressed in human terms rather than in numbers and technobabble. Reform-resistant teachers are often accused of being anti-data, but the problem with much of the data we’re offered by education technicians is that it is flat and meager compared to what we are used to gathering on a daily basis. To reduce and aspect of a student’s behavior, performance or existence to a single digit on some manufactured scale means I must actually flatten or simplify the data I have, throwing out plenty that is valuable. It’s like coming up with a digital rating for a kiss. It can be done, but what I end up with will be far less descriptive, rich or thorough than a poem or a song or a description. Data Overlords don’t like verbal packages of data because they are messy, but the only way to make them less messy is to throw a bunch of extra data out. The resulting digit score actually contains less data than the messy version-- and the mess that we’ve thrown out can be hugely important. We complain a lot about what the Data Overlords decide to focus on, but what they choose to ignore is at least as large a part of the problem. But Big Data requires digital data so that it can be crunched and spread-sheeted and used for big picture centralized measuring and planning (someday we will have to talk about Seeing Like a State, a somewhat wonky but also brilliant book about this phenomenon). And in the process, Big Data has also usurped the answer to the question, What data are important, and which can be safely ignored? In fact, the shift to digital data is about a shift in audience -- schools are no longer expected to be accountable to local taxpayers and parents, but to some larger government or corporate entity. If I give Pat’s parents that digital data report, their first question will be some version of, What does that mean in plain English. And then I’ll give them the second explanation, which will have far more data in a far more useful context. Do not buy the idea that teachers do not gather data. We have never done anything except gather data. What we haven’t done is gather bad flattened data selected according to the instructions of functionaries who are far away from the intersection of the rubber and the road. And just because it’s a digit, that doesn’t mean it’s good data -- in fact, it may be exactly the opposite."
EDUCATION,The Political Is Personal: How The GOP Tax On Tuition Waivers Would Affect My Students,"The House GOP plan would tax tuition waivers, opening a new front in Republicans’ war on higher education. This plan is particularly cruel and cold-hearted because most graduate students can only pursue a masters or doctorate because the tuition waiver supplements their meager stipend. Adding tax on the tuition waiver will simply mean many students will no longer be able to attend graduate school. Numerous articles have documented the general impact of this proposed tax. I want to make it personal by considering specifically how this would impact my students, to give a face to this tax by looking at the real people it will drastically affect. In my program, Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, at Oregon State University, the stipend for MA students is just over $10,000 for nine months of 13-14 hours per week of labor. For our Ph.D. students, the stipend is $17,640 for 20 hours per week of work. Our graduate TAs are indispensable to our program. They teach a number of online and on-campus undergraduate courses, many of which are in the university’s general education curriculum. The university values their tuition and fees waiver at $18,831. Currently, that amount is not taxed, but under the House GOP plan, students would pay taxes, not only on the stipend as they currently do, but also on the value of the waiver. While an additional tax of a few hundred to a couple of thousand dollars may not seem much to Republican legislators, for my students, it means the difference between being able to stay in school or not. Around 145,000 graduate students nationwide receive tuition waivers. Our WGSS program right now offers twenty-one of them, and here’s what the Republican plan would mean for my students. Most of my students enroll already facing tremendous structural barriers—they are mostly women and trans/non-binary people; many are students of color; many are queer; most are first generation university students; many come from poor and working class backgrounds; many have disabilities; many are international students. Very, very few of them, if any, could attend graduate school without the tuition waiver and stipend. Now, the possibility of an additional tax threatens that already tenuous opportunity. I first met Nyk two summers ago when he was an OSU online anthropology student living in Ohio. Nyk participated in a short term study abroad program I co-led in Guatemala, Women in Resistance. Nyk’s health issues had mostly kept him confined to his childhood home. He was quiet and shy and incredibly bright. With some improvements in his health, he decided to take the risk of studying social justice issues abroad, and, by the time the trip ended, he had resolved to move to Oregon and finish his degree by taking some classes on campus. With his confidence growing, he also decided to apply to graduate school. Nyk is a self-described disabled, queer, trans, Native American student who was only able to accept our program’s offer of a place in the masters’ cohort because of the tuition waiver and stipend, which he says barely allows him to pay his rent and feed himself. In fact, his first term he had to borrow textbooks because he did not have enough money left over to buy them. He says that the tax increase would mean he would have to leave the program because he could not afford to stay. Education is one of the surest ways for people to create greater social and financial security for themselves, and yet the GOP plan promises to shortcut that possibility for thousands of graduate students. For most of my students, surviving economically during the years of graduate study is difficult at best. For many, like Nyk, the choice is often already between food and textbooks. If the GOP plan passes, many students will have no choice at all because their only path to graduate school will be effectively blocked. Another of my students is an American citizen who has lived outside the U.S. for most of her life. She moved to Corvallis with her partner, who is not a citizen, and her daughter to attend graduate school. Her partner has not yet received a work permit, and so the entire family is living off her stipend. She says most of the money goes for rent, and she has asked family to help with food and books. If Congress implements the Republican House tax plan, she will not be able to stay in school. Lisa is a graduate student in our program. Her husband, the first in his family to go to college, is an undergraduate. His family thinks he’s wasting his time and wants him to get a job as a laborer. Lisa is supporting them both with her stipend. She says that the increased tax would mean that she would have to take a second job, cutting down on her time for study and likely extending her degree program beyond the expected two years for a masters. As Republicans have attacked higher education in general, they have also often singled out cultural studies, ethnic studies, and women, gender, and sexuality studies as examples of wasted money in politically correct disciplines that don’t get people jobs. Here’s the truth in my program though. Our students don’t come to graduate school to acquire wealth. They come to change the world. And they do get jobs."
EDUCATION,Judicial Negligence Compounds Political Negligence In South Carolina,"Conservative politics as a very thin veneer for racism and class warfare has long characterized the South, including South Carolina, regardless of party affiliation -- once Democratic and now the same sort of recalcitrant Republican. Strom Thurmond personified this ugly fact of my home state -- he, a brash racist and among the now seemingly endless line of powerful white men who also viewed and treated women as subhuman. The current disaster of Roy Moore stands as yet more of the same, embodying a crass blend of political, judicial and moral bankrupcy popular in the South, the Bible Belt. The 21st century, regretfully, has not exorcised these ghosts in the machine, as SC remains nearly a cartoon version of Southern stereotypes. South Carolina public schools (and public universities, in fact) exist in 2017 as a bold middle finger to everything promised by a democratic nation. But despite the political rhetoric, South Carolina has failed its public schools; public schools have not failed our state, whose political leaders care none at all about poor black or brown children being currently (and historically) underserved by K-12 education. Political negligence of public schools -- or, more accurately, negligence of public schools that serve the most vulnerable children and communities in the state -- is one of the perverse traditions that defines South Carolina. Popularized as the Corridor of Shame, political and judicial negligence thrives in pockets all over South Carolina, not just along the I-95 corridor that bisects the more affluent midlands and upper state from the crippling rural poverty. This poverty dominates much of the lower state except for pockets of affluence in coastal havens for the wealthy and the riches of tourism. The conservative ideology driving political negligence has withstood the slow drag of South Carolina’s courts, which have now fallen lockstep into the same sterile argument about pouring more money into an outmoded system -- as if South Carolina has ever flooded public institutions with money. Political and judicial negligence in South Carolina -- a microcosm of the same negligence nationally -- remains entrenched in commitments to ideology over evidence, hard truths neither political leadership nor judicial pronouncements will admit. First and foremost, one hard truth is that public schools in South Carolina are mostly labeled failures or successes based on the coincidence of what communities and students those schools serve. Schools serving affluent (and mostly white) communities and students are framed as good schools, while schools serving poor (and often black and brown) communities and students are framed as bad or failing. These schools also serve a large number of  English language learners and students with special needs."
EDUCATION,"Fizz! Pop! Bang! Teachers Find New Science Standards Fun, But Costly","With their emphasis on hands-on experiments, California’s new science standards have turned classrooms into noisy, messy laboratories. That’s been popular with students and teachers who say it’s a more effective way to learn science than studying textbooks and memorizing facts, but the cost of all those underwater robots and exploding chemicals has left some teachers wondering how they can successfully implement the standards with ever-restricting budgets. I love the new standards, I really do. But it’s so expensive, I just don’t see how it’s going to happen, said Laura Ruiz, a science teacher at Hollenbeck Middle School in Los Angeles Unified. All of us teachers are spending hundreds of dollars a year of our own money to purchase supplies. Is there a cheap way to teach these standards? I’m trying to find one, but I just don’t think so. The new K-12 standards, called the Next Generation Science Standards, were approved by the California State Board of Education in 2013 and are gradually rolling out in districts across the state. All schools are expected to have fully implemented the new standards by spring 2019, when the state gives its first official assessments. Hundreds of schools have already switched to the new standards, which are intended to give students a deeper understanding of scientific concepts by conducting as many as three or four science experiments a week. But even the simplest science experiments cost money. Vinegar and baking soda for 150 middle-schoolers to make their own volcanoes costs at least $50. For a lesson on thermal energy, calcium chloride, ammonium nitrate and plastic baggies for 150 students to make their own hand-warmers can cost at least $65. At the California Science Teachers Association conference in October, dozens of companies filled the exhibition hall hawking their Next Generation-aligned science gizmos, ranging from plastic atom models to $5,200 robotics kits. But most of those gadgets are out of the question for teachers like Ruiz, who has a $200 annual budget for science supplies. She tries to give her students one hands-on project a week, which means she must be creative. She’ll try to stretch out a project over several days or weeks, having the students try different variations of the same scientific principle. Or she’ll apply for grants to fund specific projects, although grant applications can take hours to complete, take months to come through and sometimes don’t result in funding at all. Asking students to bring supplies from home or ask for money from their parents is also an option, although not ideal because 95 percent of her students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Still, the students sell chocolate bars every year to raise money to attend an overnight science camp. Elizabeth Walsh, a science education professor at San Jose State University, said Ruiz’s experience is not unusual. The new science standards may be popular, but they’ve been easier for wealthy districts to implement than those with less money, she said. You don’t need a $3,000 piece of fancy equipment to teach Next Generation Science Standards, but you do need the basics, she said. You need a working Wi-Fi connection. You need beakers. You need measuring equipment. You want your students to participate in real science, like real scientists do, and that costs money. In general, districts with more resources can invest in higher-quality science materials, and districts with less money are forced to shift the cost onto teachers and students, she said. The result is that lower-income students might not receive the full benefit of the Next Generation Science Standards — an unfortunate irony, Walsh said, because the standards are intended to promote science among students who are under-represented in the field. That kind of inequity has been a reality in our educational system for a long time, and will continue to be until the funding mechanisms change,she said. The fact is, some teachers are getting thousands to buy Next Generation materials and some haven’t even been trained in the standards yet. It’s an equity issue. Dozens of grants are available for science teachers, ranging from pet store coupons to fund a classroom pet, to $5,000 from Toshiba for hands-on engineering projects. Some teachers have been turning to a nonprofit website called DonorsChoose.org, where teachers describe the project they hope to fund, post pictures of their students, delineate the costs and hope the public donates. Founded in 2003, the website has helped raise more than $600 million for U.S. classrooms and served nearly 400,000 teachers. Since the Next Generation Science Standards were introduced nationally in 2011, the amount of annual donations has more than tripled, from $34 million that year to $113 million in 2016, in part due to school budget cuts and a rush of science teachers asking for donations, said DonorsChoose.org vice president Chris Pearsall. If we weren’t here, many of these teachers would be spending that money out of their own pockets, he said. The teachers we hear from say they’re not going to let funding challenges stop them from helping their students. … We hope we can lighten the burden for teachers. At a high school in Carson, near Los Angeles, a teacher was asking for $198 for paper and markers so he could teach his students graphing. In San Pablo, in the Bay Area, an elementary teacher was asking for $195 for owl pellets and a magnetic easel for a life science lesson. An elementary teacher in Fresno was asking for $168 for blocks and a microscope. About 75 percent of the projects listed on DonorsChoose.org get funded, Pearsall said, either though individual donations or by foundations. Among the best-selling materials for the Next Generation Science Standards are FOSS kits, which are boxes of scales, thermometers, funnels, silkworm eggs, globes and other materials for K-8 science experiments. FOSS, which stands for Full Option Science System, is used by 20,000 schools and districts, including Los Angeles Unified and the New York City public schools. But FOSS kits are not inexpensive. To outfit a 5th-grade classroom with the full set of three kits — Mixtures and Solutions, Earth and Sun and Living Systems — would cost $4,500. But the kits provide materials for two or three science experiments a week for a school year, and the materials are designed to last nine years, said Mariel Warnock, senior campaign manager at Delta Education, the company that produces FOSS kits. To pay for the kits, some schools turn to DonorsChoose.org, fundraise or apply for grants, she said. Some states use the federal money from their Every Student Succeeds Act allotments. And Delta Education works with districts to find affordable options, she said. At Yuba Environmental Science Charter Academy, a K-8 school in rural Yuba County, middle school science teacher Deborah Burdette has become a master at applying for grants. After years of spending hundreds of dollars a year out-of-pocket on supplies, she now collects thousands in grants from corporations and education foundations. It takes a lot of time and sometimes you have to apply months in advance, but when they come through it’s pretty cool, she said. With one of her grants, she purchased garden supplies, allowing her students to study soil, water cycles, decomposition, food supplies and other topics that are part of the Next Generation Science Standards. With an annual supply budget of $250, she’s also become an expert in low-cost science experiments. Among her students’ favorite projects: spinning spider webs out of dental floss, building paper chairs that can hold a stuffed animal, testing humidity with glass jars and making weather gauges out of thermometers and empty milk cartons."
EDUCATION,Florida's Teacher Gap Is No Mystery,"All of this over and above the continued drip, drip, drip of starving public schools of resources and finding new ways to treat public school teachers with disrespect. And the pay stinks. There is no reason to be surprised that Florida teachers are fleeing. And the article notes just how much fleeing is going on. Broward County lost 1,000 teachers last year -- and that’s not counting retirees. The Sun-Sentinel article is brutal, noting that the drain of teachers leads to economic problems for communities, as well as becoming a self-perpetuating problem -- as the teacher pool is drained in schools, schools become less effective, which means they turn out fewer and fewer grads well-prepared for or interested in teaching. The article piles on the anecdotal evidence. A teacher who left, tired of constant testing and lack of autonomy. A teacher who left because you can’t afford to be a single mom on a Florida teacher salary. A teacher who handles over thirty kids in an honors class because the state class size law only applies to core classes. And of course, Florida is solving the problem by opening up alternative paths, because the way to get better teachers and fill teaching jobs is by making it possible to slap any warm body into a classroom. My favorite bar-lowering idea-- Florida Atlantic University will give Palm Beach Schools a list of students who flunked out of medical and science programs so that those students can be recruited to teach. And meanwhile the remaining dedicated, qualified teachers of Florida wonder how much longer they can hold on. Of course, somehow, these champions of free market, these lovers of the invisible hand, cannot figure out that if people won’t sell you a good or service under the terms you set, free market competition demands that you offer better terms and conditions. It’s as simple as that. If you can’t buy a Porsche for $1.98, that doesn’t mean there’s an automobile shortage. Even convenience stores understand that if you can’t get enough quality people to work for you, you have to offer better terms of employment. Florida’s leaders simply insist on pretending not to understand this, even as they try to starve pubic education so that the unregulated world of Florida charter schools will look more appealing. This is like setting fire to an apartment building so that the tenants will choose to move into a shifty trailer park operation, while in the meantime you try to hire firefighters by offering $1-an-hour wages and a punch-in-the-face benefits. This -- all of this -- I have to remind you, is what USED Secretary Betsy DeVos thinks is the shining light that our nation should be following. This disastrous train wreck, this state that has worked hard to destroy its public education system -- this is what DeVos thinks the nation should be emulating. Run the public system into the ground, drive the teachers away, and sell the pieces to privatizers."
EDUCATION,The New Tax Attack On Overly Elite College Endowments Has Potential Merit,"It is already clear that many supporters of President Trump and the Republican Congressional majority have a dim view of higher education in America. To some degree, this animus is warranted, especially with respect to the nation’s most elite colleges and universities. When schools of this type routinely admit as many undergraduate applicants from the top 1 percent of family income as from the entire bottom 60 percent, there is bound to be resentment at the kind of class top colleges are waging on middle- and lower-income Americans. Public and private universities enjoy enormous tax advantages equivalent to public charities based on their stated commitment to the public good; but the facts are that the most elite and selective among them (at least according to the dubious findings of the annual US News College Rankings) have embraced business plans that are dependent on skewing their admissions decisions to favor rich applicants"
EDUCATION,Network For Public Education Study Exposes Charter School Scams,"The just-released Network for Public Education (NPE) report, Charters and Consequences, documents charter school scams supported by wealthy philanthropists, powerful political interests and an assortment of entrepreneurs looking to make money off of education. Eleven studies look at the charter school assault on public education, from Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York with stops in Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Operating behind a wall of secrecy, the dark side of the charter movement includes mismanagement, failure, nepotism or outright theft and fraud and abuse of taxpayer funds. The full report is available online. Unless otherwise noted, information in this blog comes from the report. More than 3 million children attend charter schools in 44 states and the District of Columbia. The charters include national business chains, questionable non-profits, mysterious cyber-schools, mom and pop small schools, and far too few innovative quasi-public schools. About 20 percent of the charters operate directly to make a profit off of children and local governments. But there are many ways for charters to make money, including high salaries to sponsors, sub-contracting to friendly vendors and elaborate real estate ruses that allow charters to essentially rent facilities at exorbitant rates from their corporate partners. The wave of mismanagement plaguing the charter school industry was documented in an audit released by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education in September 2016. Thirty-three charters in six states were reviewed, and auditors concluded that 22, or two-thirds, lacked the necessary internal controls, resulting in a significant risk to Department of Education funds. NPE found ingenious strategies for turning so-called non-profit charter schools into profit-making enterprises. KIPP (the Knowledge is Power Program) is one of the largest charter chains in the United States. It operates 209 schools with approximately 90,000 students. KIPP schools, which each has its own revenue stream, are supported by the KIPP Foundation that acts as the networks central office. According to NPE findings, the foundation’s 2014 expenses were over 72 million dollars — more than $360,000 a school. That included over $2 million dollars spent on fundraising and administrative costs of nearly $6 million dollars. At the same time the foundation claimed to be operating at a $3 million dollar loss, it managed to pay its top leaders quite well. KIPP co-founder David Levin’s compensation package was nearly $475,000, just from the foundation. Co-founder Mike Feinberg was paid $219,596 from KIPP Inc.’s Houston division and another $221,461 from the KIPP Foundation. Feinberg claimed he earned his money by working 50 hours a week for KIPP’s Houston Schools and another 40 hours a week for the foundation. Levin and Feinberg are not even the highest paid charter kleptocrats. At Success Academy in New York City, CEO Eva Moscowitz received $600,000 in 2014 for managing 41 charter schools. But the real dollar winner is probably Stuart J. Udell, CEO of the for-profit K-12 online charter provider. His base salary was $650,000, and he received a performance-based bonus, equity incentives, and a sign-on bonus of $400,000. In 2013, K12’s Colorado charter chain had a four-year graduation rate of only 21.5 percent, so its CEO’s performance bonus clearly was not based on the performance of the company’s students. Charters have also discovered ingenious ways of promoting their brands. The Washington Post publishes a list of America’s Most Challenging High Schools based on the number of AP and IB tests taken by the school’s students divided by the number of graduates. Initially the list was dominated by public schools located in affluent communities, but now most of the top-ranked schools are charters, nine out of 10 in 2017. Since the list ignores how well students do on the exams, these charters simply make their students sit for the tests as a requirement for graduation. Then they promote their high ranking as a justification for more charter schools. NPE did an analysis of the top-performing schools on the 2017 list and found a number of surprises. The No. 1 school on the list was BASIS Charter School Phoenix. Its 2016 graduating class had only 24 students and an attrition rate of 44 percent from the entering ninth grade class. Since BASIS Phoenix does not have a free or reduced-price lunch program, nor does it provide students with transportation, it easily eliminated many low-income students. The school also pressures parents to make a $1,500 annual donation per child and charges high fees to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. Bingo! That explains the disappearing students, the low graduation numbers, and the high percentage of students who manage to take the exams. Charters claim they do not drain money away from public schools, but Dr. Joe Roy, superintendent of the Bethlehem (Pennsylvania) School District, strongly disagrees. According to Roy, charter schools suck off about 10 percent of his district’s annual budget. He estimates that if the charter schools closed and the district reabsorbed the students, it would save $20 million a year. Some of the biggest ripoffs in Pennsylvania are by cyber-charters that bill districts for the full charge of educating special needs children, regardless of a child’s disabilities or the services they provide. One cyber-charter founder was arrested and charged with tax fraud, not for taking public money, but for under-reporting how much he took. California has the most charter schools and charter school students in the United States, which is not surprising, because it also has the most K-12 students. What is surprising is the big money behind the charter schools movement. The leader of the push for charterization in California is the California Charter Schools Association (CCSA) and its politically influential political action committee or PAC. Donors to CCSA Advocates’ super PAC include Doris Fisher, co-founder of GAP; Eli Broad, wealthy builder and real estate developer; Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix; and members of the Walton family. CCSA and its allies spent almost $2.3 million last year to influence the Los Angeles school board election. In Brooklyn, New York Success Academy Charter School Network CEO Eva Moskowitz claims to do miracles educating impoverished inner-city minority youth, at least based on standardized test scores. NPE decided to take a closer look at a Success Academy Charter School in Bed-Stuy, and the miracles dissolved. Better results reflected Success’ success in keeping out as many harder-to-teach children as possible. The Success Academy charter reported that 60 percent of its students came from disadvantaged families, which seems like a lot, but not compared to the three nearby public schools where the poverty rate for student families averaged almost 85 percent, and while the Success charter reported that 18 percent of its students received special services, each of the three public schools had at least 25 percent of its students classified as special needs. One way Success remains successful is by driving out the children it does not want. At Success Bed-Stuy, the student suspension rate was 11 percent. At the three nearby public schools in was an average of less than 1 percent. The Network for Public Education report concludes charter schools are a failed experiment. NPE supports the freedom to innovate that the charter movement promises, but wants that freedom offered to public schools by the district or the state. The report does not demand the immediate closure of all charter schools, but rather we advocate for their eventual absorption into the public school system. We look forward to the day when charter schools are governed not by private boards, but by those elected by the community, at the district, city or county level."
EDUCATION,Our Children’s American Life: The Lockdown Drills,"Close the door. Lock it from the inside. Pull to open. Is it definitely locked? Shut off the lights. Close the blinds. Gather the students. Move them away from the doors and the windows. Sit on the floor. Make yourselves small. Make yourselves invisible. Be quiet. Tell the kids to be quiet. Keep phones away. Don’t illuminate the darkness. Be quiet. Don’t whisper. Don’t laugh. It’s not funny. None of this is funny. It‘s my first week at the new school and it‘s an ordinary Intruder drill. Lock the door.

WORLD NEWS,South Korean President Meets North Korea's Kim Jong Un To Talk Trump Summit,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday to discuss Kim’s possible upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, the South said, the second inter-Korean summit in as many months. Moon and Kim met just north of the heavily militarised border in the afternoon to exchange views to pave way for a summit between North Korea and the United States, South Korea’s presidential office said. Moon will announce the outcome of his two-hour meeting with Kim on Sunday morning, officials said."
WORLD NEWS,North Korea Still Open To Talks After Trump Cancels Summit,"North Korea responded on Friday with measured tones to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to call off a historic summit with leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for next month, saying Pyongyang hoped for a Trump formula to resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program. On Thursday, Trump wrote a letter to Kim to announce his withdrawal from what would have been the first-ever meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it would be inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting, Trump wrote. We have inwardly highly appreciated President Trump for having made the bold decision, which any other U.S. presidents dared not, and made efforts for such a crucial event as the summit, Kim said in a statement carried by state media. We even inwardly hoped that what is called Trump formula would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue, he said, without elaborating. North Korea has sharply criticized suggestions by Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and murdered by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear program. Trump had initially sought to placate North Korea, saying that he was not pursuing the Libya model in getting the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also said: This is the President Trump model. He’s going to run this the way he sees fit. Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s recent criticisms of certain U.S. officials had been a reaction to unbridled American rhetoric, and that the current antagonism showed the urgent necessity for the summit. His sudden and unilateral announcement to cancel the summit is something unexpected to us and we can not but feel great regret for it, Kim Kye Gwan said, while noting that North Korea remained open to resolving issues with Washington regardless of ways, at any time. North Korea’s measured response provided some solace for nervous financial markets, with Asian shares almost flat. I suspect they couldn’t agree on denuclearisation, said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. But looking at comments from both sides, none of them is ruling out holding a meeting in the future. So I do not expect to see an immediate escalation in military tension. Still, some analysts are worried the canceling of the talks could prompt a resumption in hostilities on the Korean peninsula, including renewed shorter-range missile tests or stepped-up cyber attacks by Pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by Washington. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who worked hard to help set up the summit and urged Trump at a White House meeting on Tuesday not to let a rare opportunity slip away, said he was perplexed by the cancellation. He urged Trump and Kim to talk directly. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his South Korean counterpart, Kang Kyung-wha, held a phone call and agreed to continue working toward creating the right conditions for the United States and North Korea to talk, the South’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has publicly urged the United States and North Korea to keep up the dialogue and work to reduce tensions. However, Trump had suggested in recent days that Kim’s more defiant tone followed a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official China Daily said Trump’s cheeky invitation for Kim to call or write to set up a meeting, meant the letter did not slam the door shut on talks in the future. After 65 years some maneuvering is to be expected, but all parties need to keep in contact and work toward the same goals, the China Daily said in an editorial."
WORLD NEWS,"2 Men Detonate Bomb Inside Indian Restaurant Near Toronto, Authorities Say","Two unidentified men walked into a restaurant on Thursday in the Canadian city of Mississauga and set off a bomb, wounding more than a dozen people, local police said. The blast went off in the Bombay Bhel restaurant at about 10:30 p.m local time. Fifteen people were taken to the hospital, three of them with critical injuries, the Peel Regional Paramedic Service said in a Tweet. The two male suspects fled after detonating their improvised explosive device, Peel Regional Police said in a Tweet. No one has claimed responsibility, and the motive for the attack was not known. The men entered the restaurant and set down what appeared to be a paint can or pail, which exploded after they fled, Sergeant Matt Bertram told the New York Times. The bomb was filled with projectable objects, he said. Peel Police said one suspect was in his mid-20s, stocky, and wore dark blue jeans and a dark zip-up hoody pulled over his head, with black cloth covering his face. The second was thin, and wore faded blue jeans, a gray t-shirt and a dark zip-up hoody over his head, also with his face covered. Mississauga is Canada’s sixth-largest city, with a population of 700,000 people, situated on Lake Ontario about 20 miles west of Toronto. Bombay Bhel is an Indian restaurant chain in the metro area of Mississauga. India’s Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said in a tweet that she was in constant touch with the Consul General in Toronto and the Indian High Commissioner in Canada and that the missions would work round the clock."
WORLD NEWS,Thousands Travel Home To Ireland To Vote On Abortion Access,"Voters in Ireland headed to the polls on Friday to decide whether the country should repeal its restrictive abortion laws. Among those casting their ballots were thousands of Irish citizens living in other parts of the world who traveled back to Ireland for the landmark vote. They chronicled their journeys on social media using the hashtag #HomeToVote, sharing thousands of powerful and poignant stories. Most of those using the hashtag were planning to vote yes to repeal the eighth amendment -- Ireland’s near-total ban on abortion that only makes exceptions to save the life of the mother. Some people covered relatively short distances from England, Scotland and parts of Europe, while others crossed oceans and continents to journey from places like Los Angeles, Tokyo and Sao Paulo. The eighth amendment has been in place since 1983, granting fetuses and pregnant women the same rights. The campaign to repeal the amendment has been ongoing since its inception. This latest effort came about after 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar died from a septic miscarriage in 2012 after being denied an abortion at a Galway hospital. A recent survey showed 56 percent of Irish voters said they were planning to vote yes to repeal the amendment, but the gap has steadily narrowed in recent weeks, perhaps due to a no campaign funded in part by American anti-abortion groups. Some of those traveling back to Ireland to vote yes recalled undertaking trips in the other direction to seek reproductive services in other countries. All the #hometovote celebrating feels like a response to all the silent, secret journeys that went the other way, one Twitter user wrote. As of midday on Friday, the voter turnout was higher than it was at the same time period during Ireland’s same-sex marriage referendum and its most recent general election, BBC reported. The polls are scheduled to close at 10 p.m. local time."

Voters in the once deeply Catholic country were asked if they wish to scrap a prohibition that was enshrined in the constitution by referendum 35 years ago, and partly lifted in 2013 only for cases where the mother’s life is in danger. The Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI exit poll surveyed 4,000 voters at 160 polling stations in every constituency of Ireland. A second exit poll will be released later on Friday with vote-counting to begin at 0800 GMT on Saturday."
WORLD NEWS,Trump Suggests North Korea Summit Could Still Happen,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dangled the possibility that a June 12 summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un could still take place, just a day after he canceled the meeting citing Pyongyang’s open hostility. Trump indicated the summit could be salvaged after welcoming a conciliatory statement from North Korea saying it remained open to talks. After years of tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program, Kim and Trump agreed this month to hold what would be the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The plan followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over North Korea’s development of missiles capable of reaching the United States. Trump scrapped the meeting, planned for Singapore, in a letter to Kim on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials demanding unilateral disarmament. Trump cited North Korean hostility in canceling the summit. In Pyongyang, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s criticisms had been a reaction to American rhetoric and that current antagonism showed the urgent necessity for the summit. He said North Korea regretted Trump’s decision to cancel and remained open to resolving issues regardless of ways, at any time. Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea had appreciated Trump having made the bold decision to work toward a summit. We even inwardly hoped that what is called ‘Trump formula’ would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue, he said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams declined to give details of any diplomatic contacts but said: As the president said in his letter to Chairman Kim, dialog between the two is the only dialog that matters. If North Korea is serious, then we look forward hearing from them at the highest levels. North Korea had sharply criticized suggestions by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear program. Trump had initially sought to placate North Korea, saying he was not pursuing the Libya model and Sanders said he was following the President Trump model. U.S. regional allies Japan and South Korea, as well as North Korea’s main ally, China, urged the two countries to salvage the summit on Friday. At an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said it was necessary to ensure security on the Korean peninsula, which touched on China’s core interests. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at the same forum, regretted the cancellation and said the world should keep doing its bit to make the summit happen. South Korea also would continue efforts to improve ties with the North, the office of President Moon Jae-in said after Moon’s top security advisers met for the second time on Friday. In his letter, Trump warned Kim of the United States’ greater nuclear might, reminiscent of his tweet last year asserting that he had a much bigger nuclear button than Kim. While the Trump administration had insisted on North Korea’s complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program, Pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan."
WORLD NEWS,"North Korea Threatens Again To Call Off Trump Summit, Warns Of ‘Nuclear Showdown’","North Korea has escalated its war of words with the U.S., repeating a threat on Thursday to call off the planned June 12 summit with President Donald Trump and warning that a nuclear showdown could instead be on the table. In a statement published by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, the North’s vice minister of foreign affairs, Choe Son Hui, blamed reckless remarks made by top U.S. officials as the reason behind Pyongyang’s second thoughts. Choe took aim at Vice President Mike Pence in particular, calling him a political dummy who’d offended North Korea with his unbridled and impudent comments. Pence had warned in a Fox News interview on Monday that Pyongyang could follow the Libya model if leader Kim Jong Un doesn’t make a deal -- a reference to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who met a brutal end following his decision to denuclearize after negotiations with the U.S. North Korea has long expressed distaste at comparisons with Libya. Pyongyang has said that its nuclear capabilities are far more advanced than Libya’s ever were -- and has stressed its expectation that it be treated as a nuclear state on equal footing with the U.S. and other nuclear powers. Choe echoed this scorn in her statement Thursday, saying North Korea has no interest in meeting the same tragic fate as the northern African nation. I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president, Choe said, referring to Pence’s Libya comments, according to a Wall Street Journal translation. In case the U.S. offends against our goodwill and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the [Kim-Trump] summit, Choe added, saying that it was up to the U.S. to decide whether it wanted to negotiate in a meeting room or encounter us [in a] nuclear-to-nuclear showdown. North Korea experts said they still expect the summit to happen, though the journey to get there may be rocky. In effect, President Trump is getting a mini-lesson in talking to the North Koreans even before he talks to the North Koreans, Jung Pak, a Brookings Institution fellow and former CIA analyst, told the Times this week. Mintaro Oba, a former state department expert on the Koreas, suggested last week that Trump keep calm and carry on, and that the North’s threat to cancel is par for the course. The question is whether they’re willing to go so far as to go through with it, or whether they’re mainly trying to gain some leverage [or] test how much we want the summit, he wrote on Twitter."
WORLD NEWS,Investigation Finds Russian Missile Shot Down Flight MH17,"A missile system from the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade of the Russian Armed Forces was used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, prosecutors investigating the disaster said on Thursday. The airliner was hit by a Russian-made missile on July 17, 2014, with 298 people on board, two-thirds of them Dutch, over territory held by pro-Russian separatists. All aboard died. Investigators appealed to the public to come forward and help identify members of the crew who operated the missile and determine how high up the chain of command the order originated. The Russian Federation didn’t help us in providing us the information we brought out into the open today, Westerbeke said. They didn’t give us this information, although a buk (missile system) from their military forces was used. Russia has denied involvement in the incident. There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the investigative development. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte cut short a trip to India to return in time for a cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the latest findings in the inquiry, the ANP news agency reported. A Joint Investigation Team, drawn from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, is gathering evidence for a criminal prosecution in the downing of the plane. Ukrainian Army General Vasyl Hrytsak, a member of the investigation team, told Reuters it would be crucial to pinpoint who issued the orders to move the missile system. The next crucially important step is to identify some members of the military in the 53rd brigade of the Armed Forces of (Russia)...who can directly say who was involved in the transfer or operation of the buk (missile system). The Dutch Safety Board concluded in an October 2015 report that the Boeing 777 was struck by a Russian-made Buk missile. Dutch prosecutors said in September 2016 that 100 persons of interest had been identified in the investigation, while Australian and Malaysian officials had initially expressed hope that suspects’ names would be made public in 2017. Eventual suspects are likely to be tried in absentia in the Netherlands after Russia used its veto to block a U.N. Security Council resolution seeking to create an international tribunal to oversee criminal complaints stemming from the incident."
WORLD NEWS,"North Korea Demolishes Tunnels At Nuclear Test Site, Reports Say","North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site on Thursday, North Korean state media reported, as part of steps that have reduced tension on the Korean Peninsula and raised the possibility of a summit with the United States. North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri site, which consists of tunnels dug beneath Mount Mantap in the northeast of the country. A small group of international media selected by North Korea witnessed the demolition, which Pyongyang says is proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing. North Korea’s state-run news agency KCNA reported there was no leak of radioactive materials or any adverse impact on the surrounding ecological environment. The South Korean government welcomed the test site destruction by calling it the first meaningful step to realize complete denuclearization which North Korea expressed through including the inter-Korean summit. South Korean media described how North Korean authorities called out to media to ask if they were ready to film the first blast. They then counted down. With a heavy boom that shook Mount Mantap, dirt and broken rocks spilled out from the entrance, South Korean media reported. After some time, another tunnel and other facilities were destroyed, then a third tunnel and another observation post. About five hours after the operation began, two military barracks were demolished, South Korean media said. The North Korean offer to scrap the test site has been seen as a major concession in months of easing decades of tension with South Korea and the United States. North Korea announced in April it would suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap the test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace."
WORLD NEWS,How Kim Jong Un ‘Baited’ Trump Into Canceling The North Korea Summit,"President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a highly anticipated summit with Kim Jong Un, claiming the North Korean leader had passed up a great opportunity at lasting peace. But experts tell  it was Kim who provoked Trump to ax the June 12 meeting -- isolating the U.S. from its Asian allies and indefinitely postponing talks of Pyongyang’s denuclearization. The meeting was always a risky endeavor. Trump and Kim spent the better part of 2017 trading insults and threats over North Korea’s aggressive development of nuclear warheads. But on March 8, South Korea’s national security adviser announced from the White House that Trump and Kim had agreed to meet. As discussions over the details of the summit unfolded -- where would it take place, and what exactly would be at stake -- Trump boasted that the development was proof his belligerent stance against Pyongyang could bring the regime to the negotiating table. But many analysts were unsurprised that a Trump administration short on foreign policy experience wasn’t able to pull it off. They clearly don’t have the personnel in place and the mindset to accomplish much in these delicate sorts of exchanges, said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. We can’t even reach and stick to trade agreements with close partners. I’m not at all surprised the whole thing blew up, said Van Jackson, a North Korea expert at the Victoria University of Wellington. The structure of the situation and the basic conflict of interests had not changed at all from last year. As more and more fractures emerged in the lead-up to June 12, it became clear Trump wouldn’t get the easy public relations victory he’d envisioned. This was never taken seriously as an arms control negotiation, it was only taken seriously as a stage show to make Donald Trump look big and powerful, said Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear policy consultant. I felt that as things drew closer and Trump realized like he wasn’t going to get the grand submission with Kim on his knees, that things were not going to go well. North Korea did the one thing Trump couldn’t handle: humiliate him. I think Trump was prepared to swallow the idea of Kim keeping his nuclear arsenal, but he is not prepared to swallow his pride, Lewis said. Trump is the one who’s going to take the blame for this. Trump’s haphazard attempt at a deal, followed by his abrupt exit, may have far-reaching consequences, analysts fear. The lead-up to the summit provided Kim with an opportunity to reduce tensions and sanctions, and its breakdown brought North Korea the added benefit of creating a rift between the U.S. and its Asian allies. Kim also wanted to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, the U.S. and China, and he’s done that, Schwartz said. Donald Trump fell right into it, and he has no one to blame but himself. Thursday’s news was devastating to Seoul, which appeared blindsided by the announcement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been performing diplomatic gymnastics behind the scenes to minimize the possibility of a military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, the cancellation eases pressure on China, North Korea’s closest ally and trading partner. For months, the U.S. had strong-armed Beijing to pressure Kim’s regime into denuclearization. It’s unlikely the Chinese will once again be willing to ratchet up the pressure after the negotiations provided a softening of relations. It’s unclear how international negotiations with North Korea will unfold following Trump’s decision. Experts worry the U.S. may find itself diplomatically isolated, with few options to limit Pyongyang’s nuclear program through sanctions or negotiations. At the same time, Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, has made it clear he wants to keep military options open. If North Korea starts testing missiles or nuclear weapons again, then we’re back to 2017 or worse, and we now have a national security adviser that’s gone on the record talking about a first strike of North Korea. We could be in a very different world, Narang said."
WORLD NEWS,South Korea Responds To Trump's Sudden Cancellation Of Kim Jong Un Summit,"South Korea was at a loss for words Thursday after President Donald Trump’s announcement that he was scrapping next month’s planned nuclear summit with North Korea. We are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means, South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement. South Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported. The summit’s fate was thrown into question after North Korea backed away from the Trump administration’s demands to fully denuclearize. Trump then appeared to soften the demand, hinting first that he was flexible, but then saying there would be no meeting without full denuclearization. Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence sparked further North Korean outrage with comments comparing North Korea with Libya."
WORLD NEWS,Trump And The American Far Right Stoke Hate In Canada,"President Donald Trump is changing not just American politics. Canadians are increasingly concerned that the president’s nativist and anti-Muslim rhetoric is emboldening hate groups in a Canada, which has long prided itself on multiculturalism and tolerance. This weekend, far-right activists rallied against asylum seekers on the border between Quebec and New York as riot police and counterprotesters gathered nearby. Members of the Three Percent — a militia founded in the United States that has recently spread to every Canadian province — were at the event. It’s just one of the many far-right groups that have started chapters in the Great White North in the months since Trump’s election. After he was elected, obviously the U.S. saw a spike in hate-inspired activity. But Canada did too, said Ryan Scrivens, a fellow at Concordia University who specializes in tracking far-right groups. He refers to the phenomenon as the Trump effect. In Toronto hate crimes went up by almost a third from 2016 to 2017, with Muslims and Jews the primary targets. In Quebec City, reported hate crimes last year targeting Muslims doubled the 2016 total. Two mass killings in the last 18 months have added to Canadians’ fears of violent extremism. Both attacks werehighly unusual for a country that has mostly been spared the kind of deadly violence that has become all too familiar in the United States. Last month, a 25-year-old man drove a truck into a crowd of pedestrians on a busy Toronto street, killing 10 people. A post on the suspect’s Facebook account called for a rebellion by incels, or involuntary celibates, who are part of the far-right manosphere and often espouse violent misogynistic rhetoric. The post celebrated Elliot Rodger, an American who killed six people after writing a hate-filled manifesto against women. Trump’s rhetoric has galvanized Canadian-based white supremacist ideologies, identities, movements and practices, Scrivens and three fellow researchers argue in a forthcoming article in the Journal of Hate Studies. Canada now has as many as 130 active right-wing extremist groups, according to researchers -- about a 30 percent increase since the last assessment in 2015.  Some Canadians are especially worried about the Three Percent, a group whose members often tote assault rifles at American white nationalist rallies. Canada’s stricter gun laws mean members can legally carry only items like baseball bats and tire irons. But, according to reports from Vice and other news outlets, the group conducts paramilitary training in private with guns and tactical gear. The fact that there are armed militia groups in Canada right now is anathema. This is not something that we’re accustomed to, said Barbara Perry, an expert on the Canadian far right at the at University of Ontario Institute of Technology. Representatives for Canada’s largest law enforcement and intelligence services refused to comment on how they are addressing any threats posed by the Three Percent and other far-right groups. It’s not just American hate groups that have made inroads in Canada. Germany’s PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West) has a Canadian chapter whose members have violently clashed with counterprotesters. Soldiers of Odin, originally a Finnish group with ties to neo-Nazis, is also active in Canada and carries out foot patrols in immigrant neighborhoods. Establishing what exactly has led to the far right’s growth is difficult. Although some say Trump’s rhetoric has fueled Canada’s hate groups, Canadian extremists have long borrowed far-right narratives from Europe and the United States. Justin Bourque, who killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in a shooting attack in 2014, spread anti-government Three Percent memes and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on social media. He embraced American gun culture and kept a Confederate flag on his bedroom wall. In Quebec, where some residents fear changing demographics threaten the province’s French-Canadian identity, anti-Islamic and anti-refugee groups flourish. The Montreal Gazette revealed this month that one of North America’s most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal. Quebec’s largest far-right group is La Meute, or the Wolf Pack, which frequently protests against refugees and immigration. La Meute denies it is Islamophobic, but in private Facebook messages, its leadership has discussed using pig heads to vandalize mosques and intimidate Muslims. Community groups and anti-hate advocates want authorities to take a stronger stand against the far right and for politicians to forcefully call out the groups that are attempting to put a polite, Canadian face on bigotry. Canada has its own ecosystem of podcasts, forums and Facebook groups that rail against Muslims, feminists and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s liberal government. At times these Canadian alt-right communities veer into self-parody. A post on one subreddit accused the makers of a bottle of maple syrup of virtue signaling because it was certified as a halal product. Another meme calls for making Ontario great again. The number of far-right voices is increasing, said Leila Nasr, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Canadian Muslims. They’ve become disproportionately loud. "
WORLD NEWS,Far-Right And Anti-Establishment Parties Set To Form Italy's New Government,"Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella approved the country’s far-right and anti-establishment parties’ nominee for prime minister on Wednesday, putting the nation on track to have one of the most populist and radical administrations in all of Europe. The far-right Lega and anti-establishment Five Star parties chose law professor Giuseppe Conte as their consensus pick for Italy’s next prime minister, despite his lack of governing experience. Mattarella giving Conte a mandate to form Italy’s next government clears one of the final hurdles for the two parties before they can begin to run the country. Both Lega and Five Star hold anti-migrant, anti-European Union views and look to bring the country closer to Russia through lifting economic sanctions against the Kremlin. The new populist government sets Italy up for a clash with the EU and brings more uncertainty for the country’s already fractured politics. The two non-traditional parties decided to band together after Italy’s election in March left no outright winner and resulted in months of negotiations to form a governing coalition. Italians rejected the country’s once-powerful establishment parties in the vote, leaving Lega and Five Star to fill the void. A Lega and Five Star coalition was widely seen as a worst case scenario for the EU after Italy’s vote, as both parties hold a longstanding opposition to the bloc.  Italia obtained an early draft of the coalition’s governing contract in which the two parties hoped to renegotiate EU treaties and identify ways they could potentially opt out of the euro. The documents showed Five Star and Lega also wanted to reduce Italy’s commitment to NATO, end compulsory vaccinations and ask for the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt. The parties amended the contract and watered down their stance toward the European Union in subsequent drafts, but the leaked contract was enough to cause Italy’s stock market to plunge and bring speculation that Italy could cause a crisis in the eurozone. Five Star and Lega have vowed sweeping changes to Italy’s economy, the third-largest in the eurozone. The two parties promised to restore higher pension levels, cut taxes and bolster the welfare system -- despite the fact that Italy has the highest debt ratio out of anywhere in Europe except for Greece. During the campaign, Lega leader Matteo Salvini also said he would deport 150,000 migrants within a year, and he accused immigrants of bringing crime and disease into Italy. Over 600,000 migrants entered Italy in the last four years, sparking a divisive debate over immigration and a swell of support for the far-right. Salvini has said he wants to close mosques, and critics say his rhetoric has emboldened far-right hate groups within the country, stirring dark memories of political violence in Italy’s past. To break the deadlock that followed Italy’s election, Salvini decided to abandon his party’s alliance with longtime Italian power broker Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party. Instead, he aligned with the populist, ideologically amorphous Five Star. Five Star, less than a decade old was the party that won the highest percentage of Italy’s vote. The party is led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, a university dropout who was living at home until five years ago. He took over leadership in 2017, offering voters a fresh face and vowing to fight government corruption. Although Five Star gained more votes in the election, Di Maio and Salvini agreed that neither would be Italy’s next prime minister. Instead, the parties chose law professor Conte as a consensus candidate. Conte, a 54-year-old who specializes in administrative law was until now not anywhere close to a household name. Within hours of Conte’s nomination, media and lawmakers began to scrutinize his academic credentials. Although he claimed to have studied at New York University, the institution told The New York Times that they had no record of him either as a student or a faculty member. But Salvini and Di Maio stood by Conte, and President Mattarella backed the nomination on Wednesday. Several other far-right and populist parties have joined coalition governments in Europe in recent years, including Austria last December. But unlike in Italy, most have been tethered to establishment parties that have limited their ability to carry out their more extreme policies."
WORLD NEWS,Survivor Of Rwandan Genocide To Be Country's First Female Neurosurgeon,"Dr. Claire Karekezi will return to her home in Rwanda in July as the first and only female neurosurgeon in the entire country. The 35-year-old has been studying neuro-oncology and skull base surgery, with a specialty in brain tumor removal, at Toronto Western Hospital in Canada since last year. Her 12-year journey in medicine thus far comes after a childhood surrounded by horror and tragedy. The 1994 genocide in Rwanda took the lives of hundreds of thousands, including some of Karekezi’s cousins and aunts. Karekezi told The Toronto Star in an article published on May 13 that the genocide is what sort of made us who we are today as Rwandese people because we grew up knowing that we cannot count on anyone but ourselves. Karekezi finished high school in Rwanda and then went to a local university on a full government scholarship. Her medical schooling journey then took her to Sweden -- her first time away from home. Her time in Sweden serendipitously introduced her to neurosurgery as it was the only department operating during the time period in which she was in the country. I knew nothing about neurosurgery, I had no training in brain anatomy, Karekezi told The Star, who had initial plans to study radiology. The course of her life drastically changed since then, taking her everywhere from England to Morocco as she honed her skills and practice. She hopes that when she finally returns to Rwanda, she’ll collaborate with the four male neurosurgeons currently practicing in the country to launch a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology center."
WORLD NEWS,Australian Archbishop Convicted Of Covering Up Child Sex Abuse,"Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson was found guilty Tuesday of covering up a priest’s sexual abuse of boys dating back to the 1970s. Wilson, who faces a maximum of two years imprisonment, is the most senior Roman Catholic Church official to be convicted in abuse scandals that have swept through the church hierarchy in recent decades. He failed to act after learning that priest James Fletcher reportedly abused four boys. I am obviously disappointed at the decision published today, Wilson said in a statement. I will now have to consider the reasons and consult closely with my lawyers to determine the next steps. The conviction comes just weeks after it was announced that Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican’s treasurer and third-highest official, would stand trial on sexual abuse charges related to his time as the archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney. Pell is accused of ignoring misconduct accusations against priests."
WORLD NEWS,Commander Says Iran’s People Will Respond To Pompeo's Threats With A Punch In The Mouth,"A senior Iranian military commander poured scorn on U.S. threats to tighten sanctions on Tuesday, saying the Islamic Republic’s people would respond by punching U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the mouth. Pompeo said on Monday Washington would impose new penalties if Tehran did not make sweeping changes, including dropping its nuclear program and pulling out of the Syrian civil war. Two weeks after President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, his administration has threatened to impose the strongest sanctions in history, setting Washington and Tehran further on a course of confrontation. The people of Iran should stand united in the face of this and they will deliver a strong punch to the mouth of the American Secretary of State and anyone who backs them, Ismail Kowsari, the deputy commander of the Sarollah Revolutionary Guards base in Tehran said, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency. Who are you and America to tell us to limit the range of ballistic missiles? Kowsari said, according to ILNA. History has shown that with the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America is the top criminal with regard to missiles, he added. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the branch of the Revolutionary Guards that carries out operations outside Iran’s borders, was singled out by Pompeo as a top troublemaker in the Middle East. Kowsari said that the Iranian people back Soleimani. Soleimani is not a single person. The great people of Iran support him, Kowsari said."
WORLD NEWS,Mark Zuckerberg Extends Facebook Apology Tour With European Gig,"Mark Zuckerberg addressed members of the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, continuing an apology-and-explanation tour the Facebook CEO kicked off last month when he testified before the U.S. Congress. The European and U.S. inquiries concern the same fundamental questions about the social media giant, triggered by the news that Facebook permitted Cambridge Analytica to harvest the private data of 87 million users and that Facebook failed to take action when it became clear in 2016 that foreign actors were using its platform to spread disinformation and undermine democratic processes. Here’s Zuckerberg’s defense, in short: Oeps! Het spijt me! That’s Flemish for Whoops! I am very sorry! In his opening statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg reiterated what’s become a common refrain, acknowledging both that his company failed to properly safeguard its users’ data and that it was caught unprepared to counteract political meddling during past elections. As he’s done before, he assured the European politicians that Facebook now takes both issues seriously, but he stopped short of promising they won’t arise again. Zuckerberg was originally scheduled to speak privately, but agreed to have the questioning streamed online under pressure from European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. Some of the sharpest queries came from Belgian member Guy Verhofstadt, who called out Zuckerberg for Facebook’s long history of apologizing for its mistakes and then failing to actually correct them. He noted the similarities between Facebook and the global banking system, which assured watchdogs in 2006 that it was doing a great job of self-regulation. A historic global recession soon followed, set off by banking malfeasance. I really think we have a big problem here and it’s not solved by saying, ‘We’re going to fix it ourselves,’ Verhofstadt said. Then he asked Zuckerberg directly if he wants to be remembered, together with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, as having enriched our world and societies or if he wants to simply be the genius that created a digital monster that is destroying our democracies and our societies. The meeting constituted Zuckerberg’s sole address to European politicians ahead of the May 25 implementation date for strict new data privacy rules under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Zuckerberg declined an invitation to separately address lawmakers in the U.K., where Facebook is under fire for its role in the country’s 2016 vote to leave the EU. Unlike his testimony in the U.S., where members of Congress took turns questioning Zuckerberg and hearing his answers, the European politicians all spoke first and then Zuckerberg addressed their questions in one long statement at the end. That format proved problematic, as several members objected when he ignored the specifics and stuck to discussing their high level concerns."
WORLD NEWS,Venezuela's Socialist Leader Nicolas Maduro Re-Elected Amid Allegations Of Irregularities,"Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro faced fresh international censure on Monday after re-election in a vote foes denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation.The 55-year-old successor to former president Hugo Chavez hailed his win as a victory against imperialism, but his main rival refused to recognize the result alleging irregularities. Thousands of Maduro supporters, many wearing red berets, hugged and danced outside the Miraflores presidential palace as the results came in, under confetti in the yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan national flag. The revolution is here to stay! a jubilant Maduro told the crowd, promising to prioritize economic recovery after five years of recession in the nation of 30 million people. Let’s go, Nico! his supporters chanted until after midnight during party scenes in downtown Caracas. We mustn’t cave to any empire, or go running to the International Monetary Fund as Argentina did. The opposition must leave us alone to govern, said government supporter Ingrid Sequera, 51, wearing a T-shirt with a logo of Chavez’s eyes. Declaring Sunday’s vote a sham, the United States is now threatening sanctions on Venezuela’s all-important oil sector, which is already reeling from falling output, a brain-drain and creaking infrastructure. The European Union and major Latin Americans repeatedly warned in advance that conditions were unfair. Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera was scathing about Sunday’s vote. Venezuela’s elections do not meet minimum standards of true democracy, he said. Like most major democratic nations, Chile does not recognize these elections. Panama’s government followed suit, quickly saying it would not recognize the result. But fellow leftist-run nations Cuba and El Salvador sent congratulations. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition boycotted the vote, given that two of its most popular leaders were barred, authorities had banned the coalition and various of its parties from using their names, and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists. The government used ample state resources during the campaign and pressure was put on state workers to vote. The election board said Maduro took 5.8 million votes, versus 1.8 million for his chief challenger Henri Falcon, a former governor who broke with the boycott to stand. Turnout at the election was 46 percent, it said, way down from the 80 percent at the last presidential vote in 2013. Falcon called for a new vote, complaining about the government’s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called red spots close to polling stations nationwide. Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued fatherland cards at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a prize promised by Maduro. The fatherland cards are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers. Maduro now faces a colossal task to turn around Venezuela’s moribund economy and offered no specifics on reforming two decades of state-led policies. The bolivar currency is down 99 percent over the past year and inflation is at an annual 14,000 percent, according to the National Assembly. Furthermore, Venezuela’s multiple creditors are considering accelerating claims on unpaid foreign debt, while oil major ConocoPhillips has been taking aggressive action to seize state oil company PDVSA’s assets over a 2007 nationalization. Though increasingly shunned in the West, Maduro can at least count on the support of major powers China and Russia, who have provided billions of dollars’ funding in recent years. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed the Venezuelan government and people could handle their own affairs and that everyone should respect the choice of the Venezuelan people. Asked if China had sent congratulations to Maduro, he said China would handle this in accordance with diplomatic convention, but did not elaborate. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a strident critic of Maduro, urged isolation of his government and said he supported all policy options to return Venezuela to democracy. President Donald Trump has said in the past he would not rule out military action against Venezuela."
WORLD NEWS,Iran Says Europe's Support For Nuclear Deal Isn't Enough After America's Withdrawal,"The European Union is not doing enough to preserve the benefits for Iran from the 2015 international nuclear pact following the withdrawal of the United States, Iran’s foreign minister told the EU’s energy chief on Sunday. Miguel Arias Canete, European Commissioner for energy and climate, said Tehran wanted the 28-nation bloc to act fast to preserve its oil trade with Iran, and to consider making direct euro-denominated payments for Iranian oil to Iran’s central bank, bypassing the U.S. financial system. With the withdrawal of America .... the European political support for the accord is not sufficient, Mohammad Javad Zarif told Arias Canete in Tehran, Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported. Since President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, the U.S. Treasury said Washington would reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. The EU leaders have pledged to try to keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing, but conceded that would not be easy. We have to preserve this agreement so we don’t have to negotiate a new agreement, Arias Canete told Western journalists after two days of meetings with Iranian officials in Tehran. Under the deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions. With the threat of new U.S. sanctions looming over them, some foreign firms have already started signaling their intention to pull back from Iran. The announcement of the possible withdrawal by major European companies from their cooperation with Iran is not consistent with the European Union’s commitment to implementing (the nuclear deal), Zarif was quoted as saying. He appeared to be referring to announcements by several large European companies last week suggesting their activities in Iran would end or be curtailed because of the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. A top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday cast doubt on whether European nations could be trusted to save the agreement. The contradictions in the words of European authorities are suspicious. We hope that our government officials will be able to secure the necessary guarantees in their negotiations, as one cannot rely on those who vacillate and speak contradictory words, IRNA quoted Ali Akbar Velayati as saying. Following the withdrawal of Washington, Iran said it would remain in the deal only if Tehran achieved its goals - namely being protected from sanctions on key sectors of its economy such as oil - in cooperation with other signatories of the pact. EU investment in Iran, mainly from Germany, France and Italy, has jumped to more than 20 billion euros since the lifting of sanctions in 2016, in projects ranging from aerospace to energy. But to improve its oil-reliant economy, Tehran needs to attract $100 billion in foreign investment to boost its oil industry and major western investors have stayed away from Iran, partly because of the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran. The announcement, in cascade, of European companies that will not keep investing in Iran are making the things much more complicated at the moment, Arias Canete said. So what he (Zarif) is asking the European Union is that we have to have concrete solutions in order to implement the European Union commitments, which is something that we fully recognize. The options being considered by the EU to keep Tehran in the nuclear deal include new credit lines for Tehran, increased energy cooperation and implementing EU laws to block European companies from caving in to U.S. sanctions. Arias Canete said Iranian officials were keen to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions under a proposal for EU governments to make direct euro-denominated payments for Iranian oil to Iran’s central bank, bypassing the U.S. financial system. The EU will consider it, he said, adding that the EU needed to deliver fast on preserving oil trade with Iran."
WORLD NEWS,Far-Right Mob Attacks 75-Year-Old Liberal Greek Mayor,"A mob of far-right nationalists attacked the 75-year-old mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece, on Saturday, leaving him hospitalized after he was beaten and thrown to the ground. Mayor Yiannis Boutaris was attending a ceremony honoring Greeks killed in World War I when around a dozen ultra-nationalists also gathered at the event assaulted him. Boutaris, who has been outspoken about his liberal policies, suffered kicks to the head and other injuries. A crowd of angry men hurled bottles and chased him from the commemoration following the attack, after which aides took the mayor to Thessaloniki’s Ippokrateio General Hospital where he was kept overnight. Boutaris is well known in Greece for his liberal views and support of multiculturalism. He is an advocate for LGBTQ rights, better relations with Turkey and has denounced anti-Semitism. As mayor of Thessaloniki since 2011, Boutaris also advocated for a mosque to be built in the city, and officials have begun work on a Holocaust museum. Greece’s far right, which has become increasingly prominent and militant in recent years, has condemned Boutaris as a traitor. During a nationalist rally in Thessaloniki earlier this year, leaflets called Boutaris a slave of the Jews, and a Holocaust memorial was vandalized. The Greek far right, including the Golden Dawn political party, has railed against refugees and multiculturalism as the country struggles to handle migration issues. Greece is often the landing point for refugees and migrants from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan seeking asylum in Europe, which has resulted in a violent backlash from anti-refugee extremists. In one incident, far-right attackers targeted migrants on the island of Lesbos last month and chanted burn them alive.  Ourania Michaloliakou, the daughter of Golden Dawn party leader Nikos Michaloliakos, posted support on Twitter for the assault on Boutaris and said the attackers were doing their duty. Mainstream Greek politicians condemned the attacks, including Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who denounced the assailants as far-right bullies. There can be no other way. Because tomorrow it will be someone else in my place. Somebody who will be beaten up for his ideas, his religion, his different sexual orientation, for the color of his skin, he said."
WORLD NEWS,Cuba Confirms 110 Killed In Country's Deadliest Plane Crash Since 1989,"Cuban authorities said the fiery crash of an aging Boeing passenger jet on Friday shortly after takeoff from Havana had killed 110 of the 113 on board, making it the Caribbean island’s deadliest air disaster in nearly 30 years. Flags flew at half-mast in Cuba on Saturday, marking the start of two days of national mourning while authorities worked to recover evidence from the site of the crash and to identify the crash victims. Allegations of previous safety complaints against the little-known Mexican company called Damojh that leased the nearly 40-year-old Boeing 737 to Cuban flagship carrier Cubana also began to surface. Damojh declined to comment while Mexico’s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics said a new audit of the company would be undertaken to ensure it was still fulfilling norms. Meanwhile, Cuban authorities told a news conference on Saturday at Havana airport that 99 of the passengers killed on the domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin were Cuban, while three were foreign tourists -- two Argentines and a Mexican -- and two were Sahrawi residents in Cuba. Ten Nazarene pastoral couples returning home after a retreat were among the victims, the Cuban Nazarene Church said. Three Cuban women survived the crash, but are still in critical condition, said the head of the hospital where they are being attended. President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday visited the morgue, a day after reviewing the site of the crash, which is the first big test of his presidency after taking the reins from Raul Castro last month. Some locals who saw the crash say one of the engines appeared to have caught fire before the plane hit the ground. Cubana leased the jet less than a month ago, Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo said on Saturday. The carrier was struggling to meet demand for flights and was serving many domestic routes by bus instead. Cuba often resorts to leasing due to the decades-old U.S. trade embargo which makes it difficult to acquire newer aircraft, Yzquierdo said. Damojh operates three planes, according to the Mexican government. Ovidio Martinez Lopez, a retired Cubana pilot, wrote in a widely-shared post on Facebook thatCuban airlines had leased planes from Damojh in 2010 and 2011, but one of its aircraft dropped off the radar while over the city of Santa Clara. Cuban officials suspended the captain and co-pilot of that flight for problems and serious lack of technical knowledge, he said, and Cuba’s aviation security authority had recommended Cubana no longer lease from them. Separately, a pilot who used to work for Damojh was quoted on Saturday by Mexican newspaper Milenio criticizing the company for lack of adequate maintenance of planes. I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion, Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying. Cuban investigators have so far recovered the cockpit voice recorder in good condition, Yzquierdo said, and are still looking for the flight data recorder. The crash was the worst in Cuba since a Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana in 1989 killing all 126 people on board and another 14 on the ground."
WORLD NEWS,Ex-Russian Spy Sergei Skripal Discharged From UK Hospital After Poisoning Incident,"Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy poisoned by a nerve agent in Britain in March, has been discharged from hospital, England’s health service said on Friday. Skripal was found collapsed on a bench on March 4 in the southern English city of Salisbury along with his daughter, who was discharged from hospital last month. It is fantastic news that Sergei Skripal is well enough to leave Salisbury District Hospital, the hospital’s Chief Executive Cara Charles-Barks said in a statement. Britain has accused Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack and Western governments including the United States have expelled over 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and has retaliated in kind."
WORLD NEWS,Vladimir Putin Sworn In For Another Six Years As Russia's President,"Vladimir Putin was sworn in for another six years as Russian president on Monday, buoyed by popular support but weighed down too by a costly confrontation with the West, a fragile economy and uncertainty about what happens when his term ends. Standing in the ornately-decorated Andreyevsky Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, with his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people, to safeguard rights and freedoms, and protect Russian sovereignty Putin’s inauguration for a fourth term as Russian president came two months after more than 70 percent of voters backed him in an election in which he had no serious challengers. His most dangerous opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running and on Saturday Navalny and hundreds of his supporters were detained by police while protesting over Putin’s new term under the slogan: Putin is not our tsar. In a speech after the swearing-in ceremony, Putin said that in the next six years Russia would prove a strong, muscular player on the world stage, backed by a powerful military, while pushing hard to improve life for its citizens at home. Taking up this post, I feel a colossal sense of responsibility, Putin, 65, told his audience of Russian officials and foreign dignitaries, among them former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. For the short journey from his office to the inauguration ceremony, Putin traveled in a new Russian-made limousine. From now on, the limousine will replace the fleet of imported vehicles Putinuses, state television reported. Soon after the inauguration ceremony, the Kremlin issued a statement saying that Putin had nominated Dmitry Medvedev to be prime minister in his new term. Medvedev, a loyal Putin lieutenant, has held the job since 2012. The appointment needs to be approved by the lower house of parliament, but that is likely to be a formality because the chamber is dominated by Kremlin loyalists. Some Kremlin-watchers had speculated Putin might bring in a fresh face as prime minister to kick-start reforms of the sluggish economy and revive foreign investment curtailed by stand-offs with the West. By choosing Medvedev -- seen by people close to the Russian elite as a safe pair of hands whose chief quality is loyalty to his boss -- Putin indicated he favoured continuity. The choice is also likely to be parsed by Kremlin-watchers for any clues about what happens after Putin’s current term ends in 2024. The constitution bars him from seeking a third consecutive term. When Putin came up against the same term limits in 2008, he got around the problem by anointing Medvedev as president, before taking back the job after one term. Some observers believe Putin, who has not anointed any heir apparent, could attempt the same manoeuvre a second time. There is little clarity too about what happens after 2024. By then Putin will be 71. He will soon have ruled longer than Soviet Communist leader Leonid Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule from 1964 to 1982 is primarily associated with stagnation. Likely options include Putin leaving the Kremlin but continuing to run the country from another post, or bowing out of public life and handing over to an anointed successor. Kremlin insiders say Putin has not selected any heir apparent, and that any names being circulated are the product of speculation, not knowledge of Putin’s thinking. The names include Igor Sechin, head of state oil firm Rosneft; Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu; Alexei Dyumin, a former Putin bodyguard who became a regional governor, and Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin. Anointing a successor entails dangers for Putin as doing so too soon would risk him becoming a lame duck, allegiances shifting from him to the heir apparent and new turf wars being set off in the ruling elite."
WORLD NEWS,"Trump Reassures North Korea, But Threatens 'Total Decimation' Without A Deal","President Donald Trump tried to keep his planned talks with North Korea’s leader on track with reassuring words — then appeared to threaten total decimation if Kim Jong Un fails to reach a deal with the U.S. on nuclear arms. Trump, responding to North Korea’s sudden threat on Tuesday to pull out of scheduled June talks, promised that Kim would remain in power and his country would get very rich if he abandons his nuclear weapons program. But the president appeared to issue his own warning if the two leaders fail to reach a deal. Trump’s comments came after national security adviser John Bolton referred recently to the Libyan model for a North Korean pact. Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi agreed to shut down his nation’s fledgling nuclear program in 2003 so that sanctions against his country would be lifted. He was killed in 2011 by rebel forces backed by the U.S. and its allies. North Korea called Bolton’s reference insulting and sinister. Pyongyang has in the past pointed to Gaddafi’s experience as a reason to maintain its nuclear weapons program. The Libyan model isn’t a model that we have at all when we’re thinking of North Korea, Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, The Washington Post reported. The Libyan model was a much different model ... If you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation — we went in there to beat him. Now, that model would take place [in North Korea] if we don’t make a deal, most likely, The Wall Street Journal reported. Trump appeared confused about what Bolton meant by the Libyan model. Bolton was referring to Libya allowing international and American observers to monitor sites as it dismantled its weapons program. Trump seemed to think the Libyan model was the NATO intervention in Libya that led to Gaddafi’s downfall. This with Kim Jong Un would be something where he would be there, said Trump, who promised the leader would have protections that are very strong. He would be running his country. His country would be very rich. Trump indicated he believes his meeting with Kim willl take place. Korean representatives have been negotiating details as though nothing happened, Trump said, Reuters reported. Pyongyang called off high-level talks with Seoul to protest recent joint military exercises by the U.S. with South Korea."
WORLD NEWS,Italy Looks To Befriend Russia As Populist Parties Try To Form Government,"As Italy’s far-right Lega and anti-establishment Five Star parties look to form their country’s next government,  Italia has obtained leaked documents that show the two parties are seeking better ties with Russia and plan to crack down on migration. In a draft contract that outlines Five Star and Lega’s shared policies, the parties state they want to immediately lift sanctions against the Kremlin that have been in place since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The documents also include heavy criticism of the European Union’s response to migration and calls for a tougher line against migrants seeking asylum in Europe. Over 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy in recent years, bringing the issue of immigration to the forefront and contributing to the rise of far-right leaders such as Lega’s Matteo Salvini. Italy has been in a period of political gridlock since its election in March left no clear winner. But in recent weeks the eurosceptic Five Star and Lega parties have moved closer to agreeing on a governing coalition, a deal that would give Italy one of the most populist governments in all of Europe. An earlier draft of the contract between the two parties, published by  Italia this week, caused widespread concern in Europe. The document showed that the parties wanted to take a combative stance toward the EU, and even stated that they would look to find ways that the country could potentially opt-out of the eurozone. The Milan stock market fell after the news and investors dropped Italian assets amid fears of political and economic instability. The latest document waters down many of the more extreme policies, however, including mention of asking the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt and talk of leaving the euro currency. Even with a more moderate attitude toward the EU, the parties are expected to attempt radical domestic changes after promising to eliminate pension cuts and boost the welfare state. Economists worry that such goals are unrealistic given that Italy is deeply in debt -- making up 132 percent of its GDP. Five Star and Lega are expected to announce a finalized deal in the coming days, ending months of negotiations and ushering in an uncertain new era for Italy."
WORLD NEWS,Hezbollah Declares 'Victory' After Unofficial Results Project Major Electoral Win,"Hezbollah and its political allies won just over half the seats in Lebanon’s parliamentary election, unofficial results showed, boosting an Iranian-backed movement fiercely opposed to Israel and underlining Tehran’s growing regional clout. Hezbollah’s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, called it a political and moral victory for the resistance, as the group refers to itself and allies. Branded a terrorist group by the United States, the heavily armed Shi’ite Hezbollah has grown in strength since joining the war in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad in 2012. The gains for parties and politicians who support Hezbollah’s possession of weapons risk complicating Western policy in Lebanon, which is banking on foreign aid and loans to revive its stagnant economy and receives U.S. military support. An Israeli minister said the outcome, which has yet to be confirmed by official results, showed the Lebanese state was indistinguishable from Hezbollah, signaling the risk of Israel hitting Lebanon’s government in a future war. Western-backed Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri lost over a third lof his seats. He blamed a complex new voting law and gaps in his party’s performance. But with 21 MPs, down from 33 in the last parliament, he emerged as the Sunni Muslim leader with the biggest bloc in the 128-seat house, making him the frontrunner to form the next government. Initial indications showed the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces, a Christian party, emerging as a big winner, nearly doubling its lawmakers to at least 15 from eight. Lebanon’s prime minister must be a Sunni under its sectarian power-sharing system. The new government, like the outgoing one, is expected to include all the main parties. Talks over cabinet posts are expected to take time. Hariri is going to be further weakened in any kind of government going forward, Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute said. His ability to substantially tame or restrain Hezbollah ... in Lebanon is going to be very limited. It will lead to more criticism of U.S. military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces in Washington, he added. Hezbollah, along with allied groups and individuals, secured at least 67 seats, according to a Reuters calculation based on preliminary results for nearly all the seats obtained from politicians and campaigns and reported in Lebanese media. Seats in the Lebanese parliament are divided according to a strict sectarian quota. The number of Hezbollah lawmakers was the same or little changed at around 13, but candidates supported by the group or allied to it made significant gains. Hezbollah-backed Sunnis did well in Beirut, Tripoli and Sidon, strongholds of Hariri’s Future Movement, the preliminary results showed. The pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper declared the election a slap for Hariri on its front page. Hezbollah-backed winners include Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired Shi’ite general and former Lebanese intelligence chief who is a close friend of Syria’s Assad. Sayyed was one of the most powerful men in Lebanon in the 15 years of Syrian domination that followed the 1975-90 civil war. At least five other figures who held office then returned to parliament for the first time since Syrian forces quit Lebanon after the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, Saad’s father. Faisal Karami, son of the late pro-Syrian prime minister Omar Karami, won a seat for the first time. Iranian media appeared to gloat at Hariri’s setback. The hardline Tasnim news agency ran a report headlined: Lebanese election result puts an end to Hariri’s monopoly among Sunnis. Hezbollah’s big allies include the Shi’ite Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement of President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally since 2006 who has said its arsenal is needed to defend Lebanon. While Hezbollah and its allies do not always see eye to eye, their support for its arsenal is vital to the group in Lebanon, where its weapons have been a major point of friction for years. Hezbollah lost ground in Baalbek-Hermel constituency, one of its strongholds. Two of 10 seats there were won by its foes, one by the Lebanese Forces and the other by Future. It also failed to take a Shi’ite seat in the coastal town of Byblos."
WORLD NEWS,"Chemical Weapons Likely Used In Syria, Watchdog Finds","Chlorine gas was likely used during an attack in Syria this past February, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed. While the OPCW didn’t lay the blame with any one party, it said in a report released Tuesday that interviews with witnesses, the collection of environmental samples and the symptoms that patients exhibited in the aftermath allowed it to conclude that chlorine was dropped from two cylinders on the Saraqib area on Feb. 4, 2018. The attack left 11 people in need of emergency treatment, Amnesty International said at the time. We heard people crying for help somewhere on the road and others on the roof of a house, a volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group told the aid organization. While driving, I started to feel a shortness of breath, as if I couldn’t breathe alone, and itchiness in my eyes. I felt nausea as if I wanted to throw up. The Syrian government has been accused multiple times of carrying out chemical weapons attacks on civilians since the civil war began in 2011. Most recently, a large-scale suspected chemical attack on the town of Douma killed more than 40 people in April. President Donald Trump has twice ordered strikes on Syrian military assets in retaliation for the attacks, calling them atrocious. OPCW teams are still assessing the situation in Douma and are expected to release another report with their conclusions about last month’s attack in the coming weeks."
WORLD NEWS,Hundreds In Israel And Beyond Protest Killings Of Palestinians On Gaza Border,"Hundreds took to the streets in Tel Aviv, Israel, and other cities worldwide this week to protest the Israeli military killing dozens of Palestinians demonstrating on the Gaza border. On Tuesday, hundreds of people in Tel Aviv marched and blocked traffic after Israeli forces fired on largely unarmed Palestinian protesters in Gaza on Monday, killing around 60 people and injuring hundreds more. Dozens more people have protested around the world early this week, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada and South Africa. People, you could see, were deeply angry with the current situation, Alon-Lee Green, national director of the Israeli activist group Standing Together, which organized the protests in Tel Aviv, told  late on Tuesday. More than 600 protesters blocked roads in the city center for over two hours, he said. Yesterday in Israel all day, the TV news just showed a split screen: Half of it was from the shootings in Gaza, and the number of casualties was increasing by the minute. And then in the other half was [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and Ivanka Trump, literally drinking champagne in the U.S. Embassy opening, Green added. It was surreal and frustrating. On Monday, first daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner commemorated the official relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- a controversial decision her father, U.S. President Donald Trump, made in December. As thousands of Palestinians protested on the Gaza border 40 miles away, Israeli forces opened fire, killing dozens of protesters, including many young people. As the protests continued on Tuesday, the Israeli military killed at least two more Palestinians. The Gaza protests were part of The Great March of Return -- weeks of demonstrations running from late March until the annual Nakba Day on May 15, which commemorates the displacement of Palestinians when the state of Israel was created in 1948. Since the protests began, Israeli forces have killed more than 100 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, sparking international outrage, particularly over the deaths of unarmed protesters and journalists. International leaders condemned the deadly violence in Gaza this week, with more than a dozen members of the U.N. Security Council denouncing Israel’s excessive use of force against unarmed civilians on Tuesday. The Israeli military said Monday in a statement that some protesters hurled firebombs and explosive devices at the security fence and Israeli troops. Israel has also said that it was defending its border against the militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza and which the U.S. considers a terrorist group, saying Hamas has attempted attacks during the protests. On Monday, the White House also blamed Hamas, with spokesman Raj Shah saying the responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. A handful of U.S. lawmakers nonetheless condemned the violence, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who noted the staggering toll of the dead. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters, Sanders said."
WORLD NEWS,Researchers Uncover Secret Pages In Diary Of Anne Frank,"Nearly 76 years after Anne Frank went into hiding from the Nazis during World War II, two previously hidden pages from her famous diary have been uncovered for the first time thanks to digital technology. The Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam revealed the pages’ content on Tuesday, showcasing the Jewish teenager’s once-secret writings on sex, puberty, prostitution, and even some dirty jokes. I’ll use this spoiled page to write down ‘dirty’ jokes, Anne writes before sharing a few, along with her understanding of menstruation and sex, which she notes isn’t done before one is married.  Peter de Bruijn, a senior researcher at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, which also partnered in the research, suggested to The New York Times that Anne may have edited the pages because she hoped to have her diary published one day. Anne kept more than one version of her writings after hearing on the radio that the Dutch government, which was in exile at the time, intended to publish personal accounts of those who suffered under the German occupation. She planned to submit a new diary, which she called The Secret Annex, after the war, the Times reported. Anne hid in the secret annex with her family and documented her time there for more than two years. On Aug. 4, 1944, her family was discovered and deported to Auschwitz."
WORLD NEWS,Populist Cleric Muqtada al-Sadr Likely To Win Iraq's Parliamentary Election,"Populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, a long-time adversary of the United States, has all but won Iraq’s parliamentary election, the electoral commission said, in a surprise turn of fortune for the Shi’ite leader. In the first election since Islamic State was defeated in the country, Iran-backed Shi’ite militia chief Hadi al-Amiri’s bloc was in second place, while Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, once seen as the front-runner, trailed in third. Sadr’s bloc did not run in the remaining two provinces, Kurdish Dohuk and the ethnically-mixed oil province of Kirkuk. The results there, which may be delayed due to tensions between local parties, will not affect Sadr’s standing. Unlike Abadi, a rare ally of both the United States and Iran, Sadr is an opponent of both countries, which have wielded influence in Iraq since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 and thrust the Shi’ite majority into power. Sadr has led two uprisings against U.S. forces in Iraq and is one of the few Shi’ite leaders to distance himself from Iran. Saturday’s election is the first since the defeat of Islamic State last year. The group overran a third of Iraq in 2014. Turnout was 44.52 percent with 92 percent of votes counted, the Independent High Electoral Commission said, the lowest participation rate in Iraq’s post-Saddam history. Full results are due to be officially announced later on Monday."
WORLD NEWS,Palestinian Family Says 8-Month-Old Died From Israeli Tear Gas In Gaza Protest Crackdown (GRAPHIC),"Monday’s clashes along the Israel-Gaza border were the deadliest the region has experienced in years, cutting short the lives of dozens of Palestinians including an 8-month-old child, Gaza’s Ministry of Health announced. Hundreds gathered Tuesday to mourn Laila al-Ghandour, an infant whose family says she died after inhaling toxic fumes from the tear gas used on Palestinian protesters Monday east of Gaza City. Let her stay with me, it is too early for her to go, Laila’s mother cried as she held the girl’s body, Reuters reported. Heyam Omar, Laila’s grandmother, said the family had been inside one of the protest encampments on Monday. When we got back home, the baby stopped crying and I thought she was asleep, Omar said, according to Reuters. I took her to the children’s hospital and the doctor told me she was martyred. At least one source disputes the family’s version of events. According to Haaretz, a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Laila had a pre-existing medical condition and that he did not believe she died due to tear gas. White House spokesman Raj Shah followed up on Kushner’s remarks, placing responsibility for Monday’s deaths with Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and that the U.S. considers a terrorist group. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response, Shah said, suggesting the clashes were a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt orchestrated by Hamas’ leaders. The protests represent the culmination of six weeks of deadly demonstrations along the Gaza border as Palestinians demand a right of return to their land. The campaign is expected to end Tuesday, on the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced during the 1948 war."
WORLD NEWS,Sichuan Airlines Co-Pilot Sucked Halfway Out Of Broken Windshield,"A Sichuan Airlines pilot has been hailed a hero for landing an airliner safely on Monday after a windshield broke mid-flight and his co-pilot was sucked halfway out of the cockpit. The captain, Liu Chuanjian, told reporters there was no warning sign before the front right windshield of the Airbus A319 suddenly cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window, Liu said, according to Reuters. Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges. The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back into the plane, reported Reuters. He suffered scratches and a sprained wrist. Chinese aviation officials said one other flight crew member was injured. Sichuan Airlines flight 3U8633 was reportedly about 30 minutes into its journey from the Chinese city of Chongqing to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa at the time. The aircraft was about 32,000 feet in the air. Passengers described a loud bang, and said they felt the plane go into free fall for a few seconds before it stabilized. One passenger told Xinhua News Agency the plane felt like a stone falling from a height. Video shared on social media showed passengers wearing oxygen masks. In the cockpit, the broken windshield caused significant damage. The Wall Street Journal reported part of the flight control panel fell off, and the cockpit was exposed to the freezing, low-pressure atmosphere outside. Despite the harrowing circumstances, Liu managed to safely make an emergency landing in Chengdu, a city about 250 miles west of Chongqing. None of the plane’s 119 passengers was reported injured. Millions of people in China commented on the pilot’s actions on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo, according to Agence France-Presse, with the most popular post titled My Hero Captain."
WORLD NEWS,Even The Bottom Of The World's Deepest Ocean Trench Is Not Safe From Plastic Bags,"Almost 36,000 feet underwater, near the very bottom of the world’s deepest ocean trench, scientists came across a troubling find: a plastic bag, similar to one you might take home from a supermarket, lying incongruously in the darkness. A recent study on deep-sea ocean pollution identified the bag, found in 1998 by a robotic submersible at a depth of 35,756 feet in the Mariana Trench, as the deepest known piece of plastic trash on Earth. Scientists say its presence in one of the world’s most remote environments signals just how worryingly pervasive plastic pollution has become. And the problem isn’t limited to a single plastic bag. For the study, researchers from Japan, together with scientists from UN Environment’s World Conservation Monitoring Center, combed through the Deep-Sea Debris Database, a massive Japanese library of deep-sea photos and videos taken on more than 5,000 dives over the course of 30 years. The database was made public in 2017. What they found was a disturbing amount of trash clogging deep-sea environments, including the Japan Trench and the Mariana Trench, as well as deep-sea areas in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. The scientists said the images they scoured showed more than 3,400 pieces of debris. More than one-third of the waste they counted was made of plastic -- a staggering 89 percent of which was single-use items like plastic bags, packaging and bottles. In environments deeper than 19,000 feet, more than half of the debris logged by the study was plastic -- and almost all of the plastic found at those depths was single-use. The ubiquitous distribution of single-use plastic, even to the greatest depths of the ocean, reveal a clear link between daily human activities and the remotest of environments, UN Environment said in a statement last month. Last year, scientists were stunned to find more chemical pollutants in parts of the Mariana Trench than in some of China’s most polluted waterways. The researchers hypothesized at the time that some of that pollution had been caused by the breakdown of ocean plastics. We still think of the deep ocean as being this remote and pristine realm, safe from human impact, but our research shows that, sadly, this could not be further from the truth, the study’s lead author, Alan Jamieson told The Guardian last year. Plastic debris may also be endangering organisms that live deep in the ocean.  The recent pollution study said 17 percent of the manmade debris that was counted was found with at least one organism -- a relatively high percentage given how sparsely populated deep-sea habitats are. Some organisms were found to be entangled with the plastic items, the researchers said, and others were covered or attached to the debris. Once in the deep-sea, plastic can persist for thousands of years, UN Environment said in its statement. Deep-sea ecosystems are highly endemic and have a very slow growth rate, so the potential threats from plastic pollution are concerning. Every year, the oceans are inundated with about 19 billion pounds of plastic garbage, with single-use plastic products reportedly being the biggest source of trash found near waterways and beaches. As public concerns mount about the potential impacts of such pollution on human health and the marine environment, state and national governments, as well as corporations and individual consumers, have been pushing for improved regulations of plastic use, production and waste management. In 2015, Hawaii became the first U.S. state to ban plastic bags in grocery stores. California followed suit, and New York is considering similar restrictions. The U.K. announced last month that it planned to ban the sale of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers. The European Union announced its own war against single-use plastics earlier this year."
WORLD NEWS,"U.S. To Open New Embassy In Jerusalem, But Other Nations Prefer To Wait For Peace Deal","Israel launched celebrations on Sunday for the U.S. Embassy’s relocation to Jerusalem, a move whose break with world consensus was underscored by the absence of most envoys to the country from a reception hosted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Monday’s slated opening of the new embassy follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a decision he said fulfilled decades of policy pledges in Washington and formalized realities on the ground. The Palestinians, who want their own future state with its capital in east Jerusalem, have been outraged by Trump’s shift from previous administrations’ preference for keeping the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv pending progress in peace efforts. Those talks have been frozen since 2014. Other major powers worry that the U.S. move could inflame Palestinian unrest in the occupied West Bank and on the Gaza Strip border, where Israel reinforced troops in anticipation of the embassy opening. Most countries say Jerusalem’s status should be determined in a final peace settlement, and say moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal. Addressing dignitaries at the Foreign Ministry, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the Israeli prime minister urged others to follow Washington’s lead. Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it’s the right thing to do, Netanyahu said. Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it advances peace, and that’s because you can’t base peace on a foundation of lies. Netanyahu said that under any peace agreement you could possibly imagine, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s capital. Jerusalem, which is sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians, was decorated with roadside flowerbeds in the design of the U.S. flag and posters reading Trump make Israel great again. Tragically, the U.S. administration has chosen to side with Israel’s exclusivist claims over a city that has for centuries been sacred to all faiths, the general delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to the United States said. The U.S. Embassy move gives life to a religious conflict instead of a dignified peace, it said in a statement. Israel said all 86 countries with diplomatic missions in Israel were invited to the event, and 33 confirmed attendance. Among those present were delegates from Guatemala and Paraguay, which will open their own Jerusalem embassies later this month."
WORLD NEWS,Israeli Forces Kill Dozens Of Palestinians As Protests Intensify Over U.S. Embassy In Jerusalem,"The move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, coupled with the killings of dozens of Palestinian protesters on Monday, makes the odds of a U.S.-brokered peace even more remote, analysts said. Somewhere between zero and none, Martin Indyk, a former U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the Obama administration, said of the chances President Donald Trump might bring the two sides together and broker what he has called the ultimate deal. Israeli troops fatally shot dozens of Palestinian demonstrators on the Gaza border on Monday as the U.S. Embassy formally moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The embassy move fulfilled a Trump campaign promise but infuriated Palestinians and drew criticism that Washington had undercut its own peace efforts. Palestinian Health Ministry officials said 58 protesters were killed and 2,700 injured by live gunfire, tear gas or other means. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting in self-defense against the coastal enclave’s ruling Hamas group. It’s hard to see how any Palestinian leader could go back to an American-sponsored peace process given the embassy move and the Gaza killings, said Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to the Palestinian leadership now at Washington’s Brookings Institution think tank. Rather than calling for restraint by Israel, as both France and Britain did, the United States blamed Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response, White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters, adding the United States did not believe the opening of the embassy or the latest violence would affect its peace plan. Hamas denied instigating the violence. Trump has argued that by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of America’s close ally, he had taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table and formalized realities on the ground. Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move that is not recognized internationally, as its eternal and indivisible capital. The Palestinians have boycotted the process since Trump’s Jerusalem announcement in December. Indyk said the decision hasn’t advanced peace at all. The idea that ... it’s going to convince the Palestinians that now they should come back to the table is a fundamental misrepresentation of what they’ve done, he added. They’ve driven the Palestinians away from the table and given them the excuse not to come back."
WORLD NEWS,"At Least 11 Killed, Dozens Injured In Indonesia Church Bombings","Suicide bombers suspected to be from an Islamic State-inspired group killed at least 11 people and wounded 40 in attacks on Christians attending Sunday morning services at three churches in Indonesia’s second-largest city of Surabaya, officials said. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has seen a recent resurgence in homegrown militancy inspired in part by Islamic State. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said explosions took place in three churches and at least 11 had died and 40 had been taken to hospital. He called on people to remain calm. Television footage showed one church where the yard in front appeared engulfed in fire, with thick, black smoke billowing up. A large blast was heard hours after the attacks, which Mangera said was a bomb disposal squad dealing with a device. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. Wawan Purwanto, communication director at Indonesia’s intelligence agency said Islamic State-inspired group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) was believed to be behind the bombings. JAD is an umbrella organization on a U.S. State Department terrorist list that is estimated to have drawn hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia. The attacks come days after militant Islamist prisoners killed five members of an elite counter-terrorism force during a 36-hour standoff at a high-security jail on the outskirts of the capital, Jakarta. The church attacks were likely linked to the prison hostage standoff, Purwanto said. The main target is still security authorities, but we can say that there are alternative [targets] if the main targets are blocked, he said. President Joko Widodo was due to visit the wounded in Surabaya on Sunday, police said, while Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Masudi condemned the attacks. We will not back down in the fight against terrorism, Marsudi said in a message sent on Twitter. A spokesman for PGI, Indonesia’s church association, called on the government for more help on security at churches. PGI is concerned because this had happened many times and often taken place around the time of Sunday services, said Jeirry Sumampow, a spokesman for the Indonesia’s Communion of Churches. Nearly 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but the country is also home to sizeable communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. Indonesia has had some major successes tackling militancy inspired by al Qaeda’s attacks on the United States in 2001. But there has been a resurgence of Islamist activity in recent years, some of it linked to the rise of Islamic State. The most serious incident was in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in central Jakarta."
WORLD NEWS,Iran's President Says Country Could Remain In Nuclear Deal Without U.S.,"President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that Iran would remain committed to the 2015 nuclear deal if its interests were protected, while his foreign minister hoped the pact could be redesigned without Washington as a member. The U.S. withdrawal from the accord on Tuesday was a violation of morals, Rouhani said in remarks carried by state television. If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of America, he said. President Donald Trump’s pullout has upset European allies, cast uncertainty over global oil supplies and raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East. It has also highlighted divisions among Iran’s political elite. Rouhani made similarly conciliatory comments on Tuesday, and on Saturday, foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif began a tour of other signatory nations in an attempt to save the deal. Zarif said in Beijing on Sunday: We hope that with this visit to China and other countries we will be able to construct a clear future design for the comprehensive agreement. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Zarif’s tour would improve understanding of Iran’s position and help Tehran protect its legitimate interests. China is willing to maintain communication and coordination with all relevant parties, including Iran, and take an objective, fair and responsible attitude to continue to safeguard the ...agreement, Wang said. Rouhani has said Iran will stay committed to the deal, which China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany also signed, provided those powers ensured Iran was protected from sanctions. The three European states have recommitted to the agreement, but senior cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said on Friday that Europe was not to be trusted. On Sunday, the head of the Assembly of Experts, a group of clerics responsible for choosing Iran’s supreme leader, said Rouhani should apologise for not having obtained guarantees from world powers for the agreement. It is necessary for the president to honestly and openly apologise to the people over the damages caused by the nuclear accord, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a top conservative, said in a statement carried by state media. The head of the elite Revolutionary Guards also warned against relying on foreign powers. America’s exit aims to break the Iranian people’s resistance, which is not new ... but today’s problem is not U.S. sanctions, it’s that some officials look towards outside rather than looking at domestic potentials, Guards commander General Mohammad Ali Jafari said, the state news agency IRNA reported. On Wednesday, Jafari cast doubt on European nations’ ability to save the accord. With the deal opposed by hardliners at home, some analysts say the pragmatic Rouhani may now be a lame duck leader. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was hopeful that the United States and Europe could agree on how to deal with Iran, after Trump threatened to sanction European companies that continue doing business there. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Pompeo said the United States was not aiming at Europe when it withdrew from the deal."
WORLD NEWS,Stalking Cheetahs Give Oblivious Family A Scare When They Exit Car At Safari Park,"A French family had a very close call when the parents foolishly exited their car with their young son to take photos of a group of cheetahs at a safari park in the Netherlands. Niels de Wildt of the Beekse Bergen park noted that cheetahs prey on small game, so the family’s young son could have been at risk. He was incredulous that the family left their car.

WORLD NEWS,Der Spiegel Cover Portrays Trump As A Finger Flipping Off Europe,"Germany’s respected weekly news publication Der Spiegel doesn’t much care for Donald Trump. But after the U.S. president announced the nation is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, the magazine pulled out all the stops, portraying Trump on its cover as a blond-mopped middle finger flipping off all of Europe. Goodbye, Europe! says the digit. The magazine, which hit newsstands Friday, has already triggered an avalanche of comments. A tweet featuring the cover was quickly retweeted by Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the U.S. Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas lamented the fact that the image is how Europe now regards the U.S. When America First actually means America Alone, the United States is significantly weaker, he tweeted. The cover, created by artist Edel Rodriquez, is accompanied inside by a scathing editorial. Clever resistance is necessary, as sad and absurd as that may sound: Resistance against America, states the piece. Trump’s life is built on falsehoods: Women don’t actually lust after him, he is not a skilled businessman and he has no strategy, states Der Spiegel. Trump is only proficient in destruction. His decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal marks the temporary suspension of the trans-Atlantic alliance. He is again bringing chaos where there was once order, the magazine says. Our relationship to the United States cannot currently be called a friendship and can hardly be referred to as a partnership, says Der Spiegel. The West as we once knew it no longer exists. It is impossible to overstate what Trump has dismantled in the last 16 months."
WORLD NEWS,Italian Tribunal Lifts Ban On Silvio Berlusconi From Holding Public Office,"An Italian tribunal has lifted a ban on veteran center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi from holding public office, meaning he could run to be prime minister in the next national election. However, the decision might have come just too late for the 81-year-old four-times premier, who only three days ago gave his blessing to his political ally the League to form a government without him in the wake of a disappointing election result. Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, triggering his expulsion from the upper house of parliament and a bar on holding any elected position for six years. However, in a decision made public on Saturday, a court in the northern city of Milan which oversees the application of sentences ruled that the bar could be lifted a year early because of good conduct. Finally five years of injustice has come to end, Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party said in a statement. Berlusconi can once again be a candidate. Berlusconi campaigned actively ahead of a March 4 national election even though he was not a candidate. But Forza Italia did not perform as well as he had expected, slipping behind the League to lose its top spot in the center-right bloc. Berlusconi blamed the poor showing on the fact that voters knew he could not be prime minister. The center-right emerged as the single largest force at the March vote, while the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerged as the biggest individual party. Neither side won enough seats to govern alone and efforts to put together a coalition were complicated by 5-Star’s refusal to work with Forza Italia, saying Berlusconi symbolized political corruption in Italy. After more than nine weeks of stalemate, and with fresh elections looking increasingly likely, Berlusconi on Wednesday finally gave his blessing to the League to seek a coalition deal without Forza Italia. Negotiations between the League and 5-Star are continuing, with President Sergio Mattarella giving them until Monday to strike an accord. Both parties say that if they fail to agree terms, the only solution would be a revote, perhaps in July. A political source, who declined to be named, said the fact Berlusconi was now free to run might make him less amenable to a League/5-Star government and could work to make life difficult for it in parliament, should it take office. The billionaire media tycoon was written off after he quit as prime minister in 2011 amid a sex scandal involving his bunga bunga parties, while Italian bond yields surged to unsustainable levels at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. However, he has fought hard to remain politically relevant. Last year he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ban on holding public office. A verdict is still awaited but the Milan ruling makes it irrelevant."
WORLD NEWS,North Korea Plans To Dismantle Nuclear Test Sites By End Of May,"North Korea has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear test site for sometime between May 23 and 25, depending on weather conditions, in order to uphold its pledge to discontinue nuclear tests, the country’s state media reported on Saturday. The official Korean Central New Agency said dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground would involve collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. The Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures for dismantling the northern nuclear test ground ... in order to ensure transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test, KCNA said. The announcement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hold a summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday North Korea can look forward to a future brimming with peace and prosperity if it agrees to quickly give up its nuclear weapons. However, in spite of its pledge to stop testing, North Korea has given no indication it is willing to go beyond statements of broad conceptual support for denuclearization by unilaterally abandoning a nuclear weapons program its ruling family has seen as crucial to its survival. In announcing the plan to shut Punggye-ri last month, Kim said North Korea no longer needed to conduct tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons."
WORLD NEWS,"Knife Attack In Paris Leaves 1 Dead, Several Injured","A man wielding a knife was shot dead in central Paris on Saturday evening after killing one person and injuring several others, sources close to the investigation told France’s AFP news agency. The man attacked five people, French police said on Twitter, leaving two in serious condition and two in fair condition. The Islamic State’s news agency said a soldier of the extremist group carried out the attack, and AFP reported that authorities have launched a terror probe. The incident took place in the city’s 2nd Arrondissement near the Palais Garnier opera house, an area packed with shops and tourists."
WORLD NEWS,Israel Reportedly Fires Dozens Of Rockets Into Syria,"Israel launched dozens of rockets into Syria early on Thursday, Syrian state media reported, after Israel’s military said Iranian forces in Syria had shelled one of its outposts near the border. The scale of Israeli fire appeared to be far higher than in previous incidents and Damascus residents described seeing a series of explosions above the city from air defense systems. Asked whether Israel had attacked near Damascus or scrambled communications there, an Israeli military spokeswoman said, I have no comment on that at this time. Syrian state television was broadcasting footage of its air defenses firing at incoming rockets and playing patriotic songs. It said Israeli warplanes were firing the rockets from outside Syria’s borders and targeting Baath City in Quneitra province. Israel’s military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said earlier that Israel had retaliated for an attack on its outposts in the strategic Golan Heights plateau. He did not elaborate. Israeli media said residents of Metulla, on the Lebanese border, had been instructed to go to bomb shelters. There was no official confirmation. Syria’s state news agency SANA and a war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported artillery fire from Israeli-held territory at Baath City, located near the border. The Observatory said rockets were fired at military positions of the Syrian army and allied forces. A correspondent for SANA said strikes were targeting Syrian air defense brigades and attempting to destroy radar installations. Lebanon’s National News Agency, citing Lebanese Army Command, reported Israeli jets circling over Lebanese territory early on Thursday before exiting."
WORLD NEWS,Israel Launches Airstrikes In Syria After Iranian Attacks,"Israel said it attacked nearly all of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria on Thursday after Iranian forces fired rockets at Israeli-held territory for the first time. It was the heaviest Israeli barrage in Syria since the start in 2011 of its civil war, in which Iranians, allied Shi’ite militias and Russian soldiers have deployed in support of President Bashar al-Assad. A war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the Israeli strikes killed at least 23 military personnel, including Syrians and non-Syrians. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the Iranian rockets either fell short of their targets, military bases in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, or were intercepted. Expectations of a regional flare-up, amid warnings from Israel it was determined to prevent Iranian military entrenchment in Syria, were stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. The Trump administration portrayed its position against that agreement as a response, in part, to Tehran’s military interventions in the region - underpinning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s tough line towards Iran. The Golan attack was just further demonstration that the Iranian regime cannot be trusted and another good reminder that the president made the right decision to get out of the Iran deal, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News. Israel said 20 Iranian Grad and Fajr rockets were shot down by its Iron Dome air defense system or did not reach targets in the Golan, territory Israel captured from Syria in a 1967 war."
WORLD NEWS,Right-To-Die Advocate David Goodall Ends Life Listening To 'Ode To Joy',"Australian scientist and right-to-die advocate David Goodall chose to end his life with a lethal injection on Thursday. He was 104. Goodall died at a clinic in Switzerland while listening to the final movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, a melody known to music lovers around the world as Ode to Joy. The day before, the botanist and ecologist told reporters he was not afraid of death and had no hesitations about ending his life. Goodall was not terminally ill, but his health had deteriorated badly in recent years, according to The New York Times. I no longer want to continue life, and I’m happy to have a chance tomorrow to end it, he said during a press conference on Wednesday. Assisted dying is banned in Australia, where the British-born Goodall lived for the last part of his life. However, there are some changes in the works -- last fall, the state of Victoria became the first in the country to legalize assisted dying in specific cases. Starting in June 2019, terminally ill patients who have a life expectancy of less than six months can request a lethal drug to end their lives. Goodall is an advocate for medically assisted death for the elderly. He has been a member of Exit International, a right-to-die organization, for about 20 years. Goodall died with the aide of a barbiturate that was administered intravenously. In compliance with Swiss law, he turned a wheel to release a fatal dose of the drug himself."
WORLD NEWS,3 Americans Held By North Korea Return To The United States,"Three Americans held as prisoners in North Korea arrived back in the United States early Thursday, less than a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo secured their release. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump met Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul and Tony Kim, shortly after 3 a.m. at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, Pompeo and more than 200 members of the press were also on hand to witness their return. However, no family members or friends were present because the men have to be debriefed first, an unnamed official told CNN. Nobody thought this was going to happen, and if it did, it would be years or decades, frankly, Trump told reporters at the White House after Pompeo confirmed their release. Trump said that he was very honored to help secure the release of the men and that the North Korean leader was nice to let them free before their summit. Trump also said he was optimistic that their upcoming talks would lead to improved relations between the countries. My proudest achievement will be -- this is a part of it -- will be when we denuclearize that entire peninsula. This is what people have been waiting for, for a long time, Trump said. We’re starting off on a new footing, this is a wonderful thing that he released the folks early. I think we have a very good chance of doing something meaningful, and if anybody would’ve said that five years ago ... even a year ago, you would’ve said that was impossible.Nobody thought this was going to happen. And I appreciate Kim Jong Un for doing this and allowing them to go. Their release represented a significant diplomatic victory for his administration. Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang this week was his second in recent days and meant to finalize a time and location for the upcoming summit between Trump and Kim. That meeting is likely to take place in Singapore next month. The Korean Peninsula has been abuzz with diplomatic activity over the last month. Kim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in late April and spoke about plans to formally end the Korean War and denuclearize the region. The North Korean leader also traveled to China once again to meet with President Xi Jinping and signal that the two will likely be a package deal in any ongoing negotiations. "
WORLD NEWS,Dozens Dead After Torrential Rains Cause Dam To Burst In Kenya,"A dam burst on a flower farm in Kenya’s Rift Valley after weeks of torrential rain, unleashing a sea of water that smashed into two villages and killed at least 32 people, officials and survivors said. The walls of the Patel dam, situated on a large commercial farm on top of a hill in Nakuru county, 190 km (120 miles) northwest of Nairobi, gave way late on Wednesday as nearby residents were sitting down to evening meals. The bodies of two female victims were found several kilometers away. Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka put the death toll at 32. After a severe drought last year, East Africa has been hit by two months of heavy rain, affecting nearly a million people in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda as bridges have been swept away and roads turned into rivers of mud. In Solai, Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, said she was at home brewing tea with her son at around 8 pm (1700 GMT) when his wife rushed in to say the dam had burst and they needed to get to higher ground immediately. It was a sea of water. My neighbor was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind so he could not run. They found his body in the morning, she said. My other neighbors also died. All our houses have been ruined. Nakuru lies in the heart of Kenya’s fertile Rift Valley, home to thousands of commercial farms that grow everything from French beans to macadamia nuts to cut flowers, nearly all of which are exported to Europe. The region is dotted with irrigation reservoirs built in the last two decades to meet the demands of the rapidly expanding agricultural sector, the biggest foreign exchange earner for East Africa’s biggest economy and a major source of jobs. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said 450 homes had been hit by the floodwaters and safety engineers had been sent to inspect three other dams nearby. Wanjiku said at least one looked like it too was ready to burst. There is another dam which is also overflowing which is looking risky, she said. We are scared. One primary school had been closed as a precaution, education officials said. Arriving at the scene of the disaster, Interior Minister Fred Matiangi pledged central government assistance to those affected. Even before this week’s dam-burst, heavy rains had caused havoc in Kenya, killing 132 people and displacing 222,000, according to the government. Roads and bridges have been destroyed, causing millions of dollars of damage. The United Nations UNOCHA disaster agency said 580,000 people had been affected by torrential rain and flooding in neighboring Somalia, while the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia had taken a hammering, with 160,000 people affected. UNOCHA said the flooding could get worse, with heavy rains forecast to continue in the Rift Valley and the Lake Victoria basin over the next few weeks."
WORLD NEWS,"2 Months Later, Rio Cops Are Supposedly Closing In On Marielle Franco’s Killers","Nearly two months have passed since the assassination of Marielle Franco, the black, queer favela-born Rio de Janeiro councilwoman whose murder turned her into a martyr for the cause of police reform. Now Rio police believe they may finally be close to answering the question that has become a rallying cry in Brazil and across the world: Who killed Marielle? During a meeting with two federal lawmakers this week, top police delegates seemed optimistic about new information they had recently obtained in the course of their investigation. The delegates mentioned they could soon begin preparing hard evidence to take to a jury and a courtroom, said federal deputy Jean Wyllys, who was in attendance. The investigation still isn’t over, Wyllys cautioned. But police believe their investigation is on the right path, he told  by phone. And that path, according to news reports, may lead right back to the police. Rio’s Civil Police did not respond to ’s requests for comment on Thursday morning. But the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported Wednesday that an anonymous witness identified two men -- one a city councilman, the other a former military police officer -- who allegedly orchestrated Franco’s murder. O Globo later reported that the witness said two military police officers were in the car that fired on and killed Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes. Franco, a member of the leftist Socialism and Freedom Party, or PSOL, was 14 months into her first term on the city council when an attacker gunned her and Gomes down after an event in Rio the night of March 14. Franco was a fierce critic of rampant police violence in the city; she also opposed the federal military intervention that Brazilian President Michel Temer launched in February. With her election, she became a powerful advocate for poor, black favela-born residents like herself. Many say they feel her murder was a deliberate and targeted attempt to erase a woman who had challenged Rio’s entrenched power structures -- from its police to its political leadership -- which often stigmatized and ignored favela residents. Almost immediately, Rio police turned their suspicions on rogue militias. The extrajudicial armed groups, often made up of current and former law enforcement officials, are active in Rio and especially its informal favela neighborhoods. Franco had previously served on an investigative committee that probed the number of killings such militias had carried out across Rio. Since then, investigators have linked the bullets that killed Franco and Gomes to a cache originally owned by the Federal Police in Brasilia. Last week, reports emerged that five security cameras monitoring the street where they were killed had been turned off during the assault. And on Sunday, a Brazilian TV news program reported that the two victims had not been killed with a pistol, but with a submachine gun commonly used by Brazil’s special police forces. Additionally, two men who’d been indicted as a result of the militia investigation Franco helped conduct had visited the Rio city council building in the days before her murder, The Intercept Brazil reported. Orlando Oliviera de Araújo, the former military police officer whom O Globo’s witness named, has been in prison since 2017, but he allegedly still runs a militia group from behind bars, according to the paper. Araújo and Marcello Siciliano, the city councilman the witness identified, have reportedly denied any role in the shooting. "
WORLD NEWS,"Iranian Lawmakers Mock Trump's 'Mental Capacity,' Burn U.S. Flag After U.S. Pulls Out Of Nuke Deal","President Donald Trump is not fit for his job, the speaker of Iran’s parliament said on Wednesday following his decision to back out of the international nuclear pact on Iran. Trump pulled the United States out of the deal on Tuesday, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of Iran’s military, said Iran had not had to sign the deal. But that arrogant country (America) did not even stand by its signature, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted him as saying. President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday Iran would remain committed to the deal without Washington despite Trump’s decision to withdraw from it. The pact was designed to deny Tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons. If we achieve the deal’s goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place. ... By exiting the deal, America has officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty, Rouhani said in a televised speech. I have ordered the foreign ministry to negotiate with the European countries, China and Russia in coming weeks. If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal would remain, he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the deal with Iran was not dead and added that President Emmanuel Macron would speak later in the day to Rouhani. Le Drian said Macron’s contact with Rouhani would be followed by meetings next week, probably on Monday, involving the Iranians and European counterparts from France, Britain and Germany. Trump’s decision drew fierce criticism from Iranian officials and could give hardliners long opposed to the deal a greater edge over Rouhani. The biggest damage of the Iran deal was legitimizing and sitting at the negotiating table with America, Iran’s army chief Seyed Abdul Rahim Moussavi said, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA). Moussavi said America’s withdrawal from the Iran deal should also be a lesson to Saudi Arabia which was drawing closer to the United States, ISNA reported. Shi’ite Muslim Iran has been locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia that has spilled into the wars in Syria and Yemen, where they have backed opposing sides, and fueled political rivalries in Iraq and Lebanon. The United States’ Gulf Arab allies, who see Iran as a major security threat, expressed strong support for Trump. Under the deal, struck between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France and Germany, Tehran curbed its nuclear program in return for them lifting sanctions."
WORLD NEWS,Europeans Scramble To Save Iran Deal After Trump Withdraws,"Dismayed European allies sought to salvage the international nuclear pact with Iran on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the landmark accord, while Tehran poured scorn on the U.S. leader. The deal is not dead. There’s an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had been reluctant to back the deal, said: Mr Trump, I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You’ve made a mistake...I said many times from the first day: don’t trust America. French President Emmanuel Macron was due to speak later in the day to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, Le Drian said. Iran also signaled its willingness to talk. Trump announced on Tuesday he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran to undermine what he called a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made, which was defective at its core. The fruit of more than a decade of diplomacy, the agreement was concluded in 2015 by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran. It was designed to prevent Iran obtaining a nuclear bomb in return for lifting sanctions that had crippled its economy. Trump complained that the deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Iran’s ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria. His decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East, puts the United States at odds with European diplomatic and business interests, and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent hitting a 3-1/2-year high. The deal could also strengthen the hand of hardliners at the expense of reformers in Iran’s political scene."

Though remote work may be the accommodation that keeps you in the workforce. it’s important to talk about some of the harder aspects of working from home too.Mighty contributor Ruthy Websdale outlined in her article. “Working From Home Because of My Disability Is No Vacation.” that while virtual employment is a boost for self-care and eliminating travel. there are two emotional aspects she has to keep in mind. This includes feeling isolated from co-workers and feeling at times like you don’t fit in. Websdale wrote:It can be massively isolating working from home. It’s easy to think it’d be bliss to be alone and not deal with people face-to-face. but there’s a difference when it’s by necessity rather than choice. I’m a pretty happily introverted person. but the lack of social interaction when you spend all day in a home office is tough. You miss out on easy networking. work friends. casual meetings and even being able to interpret body language.If you’re struggling with feeling disconnected or lonely without co-workers in the next cubicle over. know you’re not alone.

jobs,Jobs report. manufacturing data — What to know in the week ahead,Economic data this week will play a crucial role in determining the Fed’s next move on December 11. Two big economic reports will be on investor’s radars this week — the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing survey and the November employment report.November’s ISM manufacturing report is scheduled to be released shortly after the market open Monday. After a few months of being in contractionary territory. most economists do not expect the ISM manufacturing index to deteriorate further so long as the trade war does escalate further.“Regional surveys have broadly improved. and we expect headline ISM to recover above 50 in the next few months. Despite some recovery. we do not expect manufacturing surveys to pick up robustly.” Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Profits growth has slowed. global growth has been sluggish. and trade uncertainty is likely to linger even if US-China negotiations yield a tentative deal.”Capital Economics echoed Credit Suisse’s sentiment. “Helped by the pause in trade tensions. global conditions appear to be stabilizing. the dollar has been broadly stable in trade-weighted terms. and the drop in interest rates is starting to feed through. Putting that all together. we expect the ISM manufacturing index to rebound to 50.0 in November. from 48.3. That would be a sign that manufacturing output is not falling off a cliff. But we don’t expect it to mark the beginning of a game-changing recovery. either. with manufacturing conditions likely to remain subdued in 2020.”

technology,General election 2019: Parties splurge on Facebook ads,"The political parties' Facebook ads campaigns had been lively enough since the general election was called a few weeks ago - but suddenly over the weekend they caught fire.On Sunday. the Conservatives unleashed a tidal wave of adverts. Their two themes were getting Brexit done. and improving the NHS.At one point. the Facebook Ad Library showed that about 2.500 adverts paid for by the Conservative Party were live.The Liberal Democrats appear to be on an even bigger splurge. The last time I looked they had about 3.000 adverts running. many of them with an image of Boris Johnson.The message was that only a vote for them could ""stop Boris"".By contrast. while Labour has spent heavily over the last seven days. the library currently shows only 250 Facebook ads running at the moment. many with a message promising cheaper rail travel.Many of these thousands of ads look identical when listed in the library - the claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built appears on hundreds of the Conservative adverts. and a Liberal Democrat message proclaiming ""You Can Stop Boris Johnson"" is repeated again and again."

technology,Apple Pay speeds up payments on the Tube,Apple has tweaked its Apple Pay service in an effort to reduce queues at London Tube-station barriers.The Express Transit feature means commuters will experience shorter payment times when they tap in to the Tube using their iPhone or Apple Watch.It works by doing away with the need to authenticate payments via face recognition or a fingerprint scan.The move brings Apple Pay into line with Android Pay. which already allows commuters to simply tap in and out.The Express Transit feature will work on iPhone SE. 6S and later models as well as the Apple Watch.By designating a specific bank card to be their travel payment card. owners of these devices won't need to authenticate transactions as they enter and exit the Tube system any more.Instead of a bank card. users can also designate their Citymapper Pass - a virtual travel card available on a subscription. starting at £30 per week.
technology,Android 'spoofing' bug helps targets bank accounts,"A ""major"" security weakness in Google's Android software has let cyber-thieves craft apps that can steal banking logins. a security firm has found.The bug lets attackers create fake login screens that can be inserted into legitimate apps to harvest data.More than 60 financial institutions have been targeted by the technique. a survey of the Play store indicated.Google said it had taken action to close the loophole and was keen to find out more about its origins.""It targeted several banks in several countries and the malware successfully exploited end users to steal money."" said Tom Hansen. chief technology officer of Norwegian mobile security firm Promon. which found the bug.The problem emerged after Promon analysed malicious apps that had been spotted draining bank accounts.Called Strandhogg. the vulnerability can be used to trick users into thinking they are using a legitimate app but are actually clicking on an overlay created by the attackers."
technology,These posh ride-sharing startups aim to leave Uber and Lyft in the dust,"I'm running late for dinner in Hamburg. Germany. with no time to walk or take the bus. Time to fire up a ride-sharing app. But rather than Uber or Lyft. I quickly open an app called Moia. It tells me to cross the street and my driver will arrive in nine minutes. Right on time. a big. golden van pulls up in front of me. and the side door opens. ""Shara?"" the driver says as I take a seat in a sleek cream-colored seat and take in my surroundings.The roomy interior is softly lit by white lights on the ceiling. almost making it feel like the vehicle has no roof. I lean back against the wide headrest that shelters my face from the other rider in the vehicle. A monitor hanging in front of me says I'll be at my destination in 15 minutes. right after we drop off my fellow passenger and pick up another. While this sounds like a normal -- albeit premium -- shared ride service. Moia. which launched in Hanover in July 2018 and expanded into Hamburg six months ago. is run by Volkswagen.Moia is just one of several new services that have emerged over the past few years to tap into demand for environmentally friendly and comfortable transportation. Its rival. CleverShuttle operates in six German cities. though it recently left three others. including Hamburg. UFODrive started 18 months ago in Luxembourg to give people an option for quickly renting electric vehicles through a smartphone app. and numerous scooter and biking companies -- from Bird to Uber's Jump -- have all but taken over cities across the globe. In many ways. Moia resembles an Uber Pool or Lyft Line shared ride: I hail a vehicle through an  app. setting my pickup location and destination. The app sends me the offered price for the ride. gives me an estimated arrival time. and tells me where and when to meet my driver. "

technology,Mark Zuckerberg: People should make their own judgments on political ads,"Facebook has faced repeated criticism for its policy against fact-checking advertisements from politicians. but CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again defending the social network's decision. In an interview that aired Monday. Zuckerberg said that it's important for people to judge for themselves what politicians are saying. ""What I believe is that in a democracy. it's really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying. so they can make their own judgments."" Zuckerberg told CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King. ""And. you know. I don't think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news."" (Editors' note: CNET is owned by CBS.)Zuckerberg has been defending the social network's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech and combating misinformation amid elections. Facebook faces mounting pressure to do more to stop misinformation. hate speech and other offensive content on the world's largest social network. which has nearly 2.5 billion users. Criticism about the company's hands-off approach to political ads heightened in October after Facebook rejected a request by Joe Biden's presidential campaign to remove an ad by Donald Trump's reelection campaign because it contains misinformation about the former vice president. The Trump ad included a 30-second video that said Biden had promised Ukraine $1 billion if officials in that country fired the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with Biden's son. a claim that has been been debunked by fact-checking groups and media reports."
technology,NASA is going to shoot an asteroid and Europe will examine the mess,"Europe and the US are joining forces to save the world from an apocalyptic asteroid impact. Or at least to start the process of learning how we might prevent Armageddon by crashing a spacecraft into a binary asteroid.The European Space Agency has gotten approval from the continent's space leaders to build and launch the Hera asteroid mission as soon as 2024. Hera will visit the double asteroid Didymos to scope out its smaller component. informally called ""Didymoon."" a few years after NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft has collided with it.The hope is Didymoon will become the first natural object in the solar system to have its orbit shifted by human effort enough to measure the difference.Didymoon is 525 feet (160 meters) across. or about the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. and it orbits the half-mile-wide (780-meter) main body of Didymos.Currently. NASA's DART is slated to launch aboard a SpaceX rocket in mid-2021 and smash into Didymoon by the end of 2022. Hera would then launch in 2024 and arrive to check out DART's work in 2026. Hera will gather images and reams of data from Didymos to relay back to Earth. and also will release a pair of cubesats that'll fly closer and eventually land on the asteroid.The hope is that all this will result in a better understanding of how we might one day be able to deflect a dangerous asteroid without having to sacrifice Bruce Willis. (Sorry for the 20-year-old spoiler.)"
technology,SpaceX CRS-19 mission: How to watch Falcon 9 launch to the space station,SpaceX rocket launches are happening so often they seem like fairly routine affairs now -- but they're still must-watch events. A brand-new Falcon 9 booster is scheduled to launch a Dragon capsule. carrying scientific payloads and a handful of CubeSats for NASA. direct to the International Space Station. from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral. Florida.The mission. known as CRS-19. will be the 19th resupply voyage for SpaceX and the third time this particular Dragon capsule is headed to space.The launch window opens no earlier than 12:51 p.m. ET (9:51 a.m. PT) on Dec. 4 and SpaceX usually broadcasts all of its launches live. with coverage to start about 15 minutes prior to lift-off. You can also keep your eyes glued to the SpaceX Twitter account for updates. Weather was 90% favorable when assessed on Dec. 1.The Falcon 9 booster will return to Earth to be reused in subsequent missions by SpaceX. while the Dragon capsule starts its journey to the ISS. SpaceX's previous launch knocked down two more recycling milestones. including reusing a Falcon 9 booster and sticking the landing for a fourth time. That landing took place on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship and the same capture is expected during this mission. 
technology,Goo Hara and the trauma of South Korea's spy cam victims,"When K-pop star Goo Hara. who died last week. was secretly filmed by a boyfriend. she publicly fought for justice. For this. she was viciously attacked online. The sentences for so-called ""spy cam porn"" are relatively lenient in South Korea. but as the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul writes. their victims can face a different kind of punishment.""I feel like he's still watching me."" Eun-ju Lee told her dad.It was around 1am. and she had called her dad yet again after waking in terror from another nightmare.A few days later she would take her own life.Eun-ju. not her real name. was a victim of South Korea's so called spy camera epidemic. Her colleague at a major hospital in the south of the country had drilled a hole to place a tiny camera in one of the ladies changing rooms. When he was caught upskirting a woman. police seized his phone and found illicit footage of four victims.Her parents played me a phone call Eun-ju had made in her final days. which they believe shows the effect this had on their daughter's mental health.She had accidentally run into the culprit on her way to the hospital. In a panic she phoned the hospital's union representative who taped the call. She appears unable to breathe and her voice is barely audible."

These days you are never more than a few feet away from a lithium-ion battery. as they power mobile phones and all sorts of other electronics. from toothbrushes to electric scooters.In recognition of that success. Prof Yoshino was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.But despite improvements. even the most advanced lithium-ion batteries can only store a fraction of the energy of a similar weight of petrol or jet fuel.And that is curbing ambitions for even smaller and lighter devices - and more ambitious projects like electric powered aviation.Batteries need to make progress. admits Prof Yoshino. but thankfully. ""there's a lot of interesting approaches"".And ""the solid state battery. I think. is a promising one."" he says."

This allowed her to access websites such as those from Google not available in China.""I was telling my Chinese friends about the bomb detonating outside the [US] embassy and they didn't know what I was talking about. because this news wasn't appearing in their search feeds."" recalls Prof Seo. who teaches courses on digital media.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade. tech. defence and soft power.Her experience is common for any westerner visiting China.The internet in the world's most populous country is heavily restricted and censored. leading experts to speculate that in the future there could be two distinct internets - one led by China and one by the US."
technology,TikTok prevented disabled users’ videos from showing up in feeds,Social video network TikTok apparently limited the reach of people with disabilities. including facial disfigurement and Down syndrome. According to Netzpolitik.org. which spoke with a source inside the company. the policy was supposed to protect users with a high risk of bullying. In practice. however. it apparently amounted to discrimination — and the problem was compounded by moderators who needed to make snap decisions about users’ physical and mental traits.TikTok fame relies heavily on getting content promoted through TikTok’s algorithm. But Netzpolitik.org’s source alleges that TikTok made this difficult for people who might be bullied. One risk category meant that videos only appeared in the country where they were uploaded. Another. known as “Auto R.” stopped videos from hitting other users’ “For You” feed after hitting a certain view count. This tag might be applied to individual videos. but for a couple of dozen “special users.” it was supposedly the default.“Auto R” seemingly applied to a broad category of people. It could cover disabilities like the ones mentioned above. but Netzpolitik.org describes TikTok limiting the reach of “fat and self-confident” users. LGBT users. or users with autism — in other words. categories of people particularly likely to face abuse online. As the article notes. though. these categories could be difficult to judge simply from profiles or videos. And while the policy was meant to prevent bullying. it did so by punishing the likely victims.
technology,The ‘Amazon effect’ is flooding a struggling recycling system with cardboard,This holiday season. the popularity of online shopping collides with upheaval in cardboard recycling. China’s 2017 decision to turn away America’s trash has left the recycling industry reeling as it figures out what to do with all the packaging online shoppers leave behind.Some municipal recycling programs have closed. Even the ones that haven’t still have headaches: specifically. filthy recyclables. All of that leads to more cardboard in landfills.The rise in curbside cardboard waste coming from packaging is “the Amazon effect.” says David Biderman. the executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America. an industry group. It peaks around the holidays — particularly as online shopping has only gotten more popular. Last year. Cyber Monday was the biggest shopping day for Amazon in the history of the company. The trend extends beyond the holidays: US Postal Service deliveries have doubled to 6.2 billion in 2018. from 3.1 billion in 2009.As Americans have gotten more enthusiastic about online shopping. China — which once welcomed almost half the world’s recyclables — has gotten more stringent about what it will accept. Starting in January 2018. China stopped accepting shipments of cardboard that are contaminated with more than 0.5 percent of other materials.
technology,AWS launches Braket. its quantum computing service,While Google. Microsoft. IBM and others have made a lot of noise around their quantum computing efforts in recent months. AWS remained quiet. The company. after all. never had its own quantum research division. Today. though. AWS announced the preview launch of Braket (named after the common notation for quantum states). its own quantum computing service. It’s not building its own quantum computer. though. Instead. it’s partnering with D-Wave. IonQ and Rigetti and making their systems available through its cloud. In addition. it’s also launching the AWS Center for Quantum Computing and AWS Quantum Solutions Lab.With Braket. developers can get started on building quantum algorithms and basic applications and then test them in simulations on AWS. as well as the quantum hardware from its partners. That’s a smart move on AWS’s part. as it’s hedging its bets without incurring the cost of trying to build a quantum computer itself. And for its partners. AWS provides them with the kind of reach that would be hard to achieve otherwise. Developers and researchers. on the other hand. get access to all of these tools through a single interface. making it easier for them to figure out what works best for them.“By collaborating with AWS. we will be able to deliver access to our systems to a much broader market and help accelerate the growth of this emerging industry.” said Chad Rigetti. founder and CEO of Rigetti Computing .D-Wave offered a similar statement. “D-Wave’s quantum systems and our Leap cloud environment were both purpose-built to make practical application development a reality today and. in turn. fuel real-world business advantage for our customers.” said D-Wave’s chief product officer and EVP of R&D. Alan Baratz. “Amazon’s Braket will open the door to more smart developers who will build the quantum future. and the forward-thinking executives who will transform industries.”

technology,Mass media vs. social media,In the waning years of the last millennium. at my university. one of the cause célèbres of the progressive left was a concept known as “Manufacturing Consent.” the title of a book and film. by and starring Noam Chomsky. Its central thesis was that US mass media “are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function. by reliance on market forces. internalized assumptions. and self-censorship.”It’s fair to say that history has been pretty kind to this theory. Consider the support drummed up by mass media for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. To quote the public editor of the New York Times. “To anyone who read the paper between September 2002 and June 2003. the impression that Saddam Hussein possessed. or was acquiring. a frightening arsenal of W.M.D. seemed unmistakable. Except. of course. it appears to have been mistaken.” Consider the September 2002 dossier published by the UK government “to bolster support for war” which turned out to be full of spectacularly incorrect information. and the media’s failure to interrogate those claims.It’s hard to overstate just how cataclysmic these errors were. If the mass media had pushed back against the false claims of weapons of mass destruction. we might have avoided the Iraq war. which killed hundreds of thousands and cost trillions of dollars. Saddam Hussein was not exactly a tough act to follow. but the US still managed to follow its falsely motivated war with a botched occupation which turned Iraq. and arguably the larger Middle East to this day. into a bloodbath.
technology,‘Carpentry Compiler’ turns 3D models to instructions on how to build them,Even to an experienced carpenter. it may not be obvious what the best way is to build a structure they’ve designed. A new digital tool. Carpentry Compiler. provides a way forward. converting the shapes of the structure to a step-by-step guide on how to produce them. It could help your next carpentry project get off the screen and into the shop.“If you think of both design and fabrication as programs. you can use methods from programming languages to solve problems in carpentry. which is really cool.” said project lead Adriana Schulz from the University of Washington’s computer science department. in a news release.It sounds a bit detached from the sawdust and sweat of hands-on woodworking. but they don’t say “measure twice. cut once” for nothing. Carpentry is a cerebral process more than a physical one. and smart. efficient solutions tend to replace ones that are merely well made.What Carpentry Compiler does is codify the rules that govern design and carpentry. for example what materials are available. what tools can do. and so on. and use those to create a solution (in terms of cuts and joins) to a problem (how to turn boards into a treehouse).

technology,Facebook updates crisis response tools. adds WhatsApp integration,Facebook  is expanding Crisis Response. its disaster-reporting and communications feature that’s been used in 300 crises in more than 80 countries. The company today is announcing several new features. including WhatsApp integration. support for first-hand information sharing and an expansion of its “Data for Good” tools for things like better disaster and displacement maps.Crisis Response originally grew out of a handful of features that help family. friends and communities support one another in the wake of a disaster. A couple of years ago. Facebook organized these tools — like Safety Check. Community Help and Fundraisers — all under a centralized “Crisis Response” centralized hub.Today. Facebook is adding new functionality to Crisis Response which will allow people in affected areas to share first-hand information about what they’re witnessing or think others should know — like building collapses or road closures. for example. This is in addition to their existing ability to share requests or offers for help. as before.In addition. Facebook Crisis Response now works with WhatsApp . This particular integration is fairly light — the entire feature set isn’t coming to WhatsApp. to be clear. But people can now offer or request help through the messaging app. instead of using just Facebook Messenger.
technology,DHS wants to expand airport face recognition scans to include US citizens,Homeland Security wants to expand facial recognition checks for travelers arriving to and departing from the U.S. to also include citizens. which had previously been exempt from the mandatory checks.In a filing. the department has proposed that all travelers. and not just foreign nationals or visitors. will have to complete a facial recognition check before they are allowed to enter the U.S.. but also to leave the country.Facial recognition for departing flights has increased in recent years as part of Homeland Security’s efforts to catch visitors and travelers who overstay their visas. The department. whose responsibility is to protect the border and control immigration. has a deadline of 2021 to roll out facial recognition scanners to the largest 20 airports in the United States. despite facing a rash of technical challenges.But although there may not always be a clear way to opt-out of facial recognition at the airport. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents — also known as green card holders — have been exempt from these checks. the existing rules say.Now. the proposed rule change to include citizens has drawn ire from one of the largest civil liberties groups in the country.
technology,Canalys: Chinese cloud infrastructure spending reaches almost $3B a quarter,Canalys  released its latest cloud infrastructure spending numbers for China today. and it’s all trending upward. For starters. the market reached $2.9 billion for the quarter. an increase of 60.8%. China now accounts for 10.4% of worldwide cloud spending. meaning it’s second only to the U.S. in overall spending.That is pretty amazing. given that China was late in coming to the cloud. but also not surprising given the sheer size of the overall potential market. Once it got going. it was bound to gain momentum simply because of that size. Still. it is surprising that it is three times the size in terms of market share of the next closest country. according to Canalys.Most of the business is going to Chinese cloud companies. Alibaba. which. like Amazon. has a retail arm and a cloud arm. leads the way by far. with 45% of the market share (worth $1.3 billion). Tencent is second. with 18.6%. followed by AWS with 8.6% and Baidu with 8.2%. AWS was the only non-Chinese company to register any market share.Wong Yih Khai. senior analyst at Canalys. says the market demand for cloud infrastructure services in China continues to grow at a rapid pace led by demand for artificial intelligence services.
technology,CircleCI launches improved AWS support,For about a year now. continuous integration and delivery service CircleCI has offered Orbs. a way to easily reuse commands and integrations with third-party services. Unsurprisingly. some of the most popular Orbs focus on AWS. as that’s where most of the company’s developers are either testing their code or deploying it. Today. right in time for AWS’s annual re:Invent developer conference in Las Vegas. the company announced that it has now added Orb support for the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). which makes setting up automated CI/CD platforms for testing and deploying to AWS Lambda significantly easier.In total. the company says. more than 11.000 organizations started using Orbs since it launched a year ago. Among the AWS-centric Orbs are those for building and updating images for the Amazon Elastic Container Services and the Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). for example. as well as AWS CodeDeploy support. an Orb for installing and configuring the AWS command line interface. an Orb for working with the S3 storage service and more.“We’re just seeing a momentum of more and more companies being ready to adopt [managed services like Lambda. ECS and EKS]. so this became really the ideal time to do most of the work with the product team at AWS that manages their serverless ecosystem and to add in this capability to leverage that serverless application model and really have this out of the box CI/CD flow ready for users who wanted to start adding these into to Lambda.” CircleCI  VP of business development Tom Trahan told me. “I think when Lambda was in its earlier days. a lot of people would use it and they would use it and not necessarily follow the same software patterns and delivery flow that they might have with their traditional software. As they put more and more into Lambda and are really putting a lot more what I would call ‘production quality code’ out there to leverage. They realize they do want to have that same software delivery capability and discipline for Lambda as well.”
technology,Twitter launches a Privacy Center to centralize its data protection efforts,Twitter  today is launching a new resource that aims to serve as the central place for everything related to the company’s efforts around privacy and data protection. The new site. the Twitter Privacy Center. will host information about Twitter’s initiatives. announcements and new privacy products. as well as other communication about security incidents.The company says it wanted to create a centralized resource so it would be easier to find all the information about Twitter’s work in this area. However. the impacts of Europe’s data protection regulation. GDPR. likely also spurred Twitter’s efforts on this front. along with other data laws.For its own purposes. Twitter now needs to have a more organized approach to consumer data privacy. As a result. it makes sense to put Twitter’s work and announcements onto a consumer-facing site that’s easy to navigate and use.The new Twitter Privacy Center splits information between what’s aimed at users and what’s for partners. On the latter front. it has dedicated pages for GDPR. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and Global DPA (Data Processing Addendum). for example.

The statement. posted at UnitedForTheParisAgreement.com. represents a group that either directly employs more than 2 million people in the U.S.. or represents a larger group of 12.5 million through labor organizations.The group collectively says they are “still in” on the Agreement. which many of the undersigned also supported vocally back in 2017 when the Trump administration announced its intent to formally remove itself. They also “urge the United States” to reconsider its current course and also agree to remain committed to the agreement. The Agreement will not only help to potentially counter the ongoing impacts of global climate change. the group says in the letter. but also prepare the way for a “just transition” of the U.S. workforce to “new decent. family supporting jobs and economic opportunity.” implying that bowing out of the Agreement will actually impede the U.S. workforce’s ability to compete on a global scale.Apple  CEO Tim Cook shared the renewed commitment on Twitter. noting in part that “humanity has never faced a greater or more urgent threat than climate change.” and other prominent tech executives have also co-signed. including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.  Tesla’s  Elon Musk.  Google’s Sundar Pichai and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen. Chief executives from other powerful U.S. companies across industries are also represented. including Coca-Cola’s James Quincey. Patagonia’s  Rose Marcario. Unilever’s Alan Jope and Walt Disney’s Robert Iger.
technology,Researchers find making a sick reef sound like a healthy one could help its recovery,A new study. published in Nature Communications (via The Washington Post). found promising early results from an experiment wherein sounds that you’d hear from a healthy reef are played back at a reef that’s dying. It may sound a bit like a bait-and-switch. but previous research has shown that one way to help reefs that are under duress is to encourage diverse and abundant fish populations. which can help counteract the downward spiral that ultimately leads to reef death.Over the course of six weeks. researchers from the U.K. and Australia played audio recordings over speakers installed underwater at dead patches found in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The recordings were taken from healthy sections. and included a range of sounds typical to thriving coral communities. including noises made by fish. shrimp. molluscs and other reef-dwellers. These sounds act as cues for young fish looking to settle down and establish communities of their own.The researchers found that up to twice as many fish ended up populating the reefs where these sounds were played. versus areas in similar states of decay where they were not. They also found that there was more biodiversity at these locations. with up to 50% more species in the mix versus the control sites. and that the new denizens who did make their way to the reefs with the artificial sounds tended to set up to stay.
technology,T-Mobile opens pre-orders on two 5G phones as low-band network goes live,The 5G question has long been carts and horses. The next-generation wireless network has always been an inevitability. of course. but the rollout has always felt a bit piecemeal. T-Mobile. to its credit. is looking to flip the switch all at once (kind of). launching a “nationwide” deployment of 5G to a coverage area it says will reach 200 million of the U.S.’s 327 million residents.The 600MHz low-band network goes live today. fulfilling the promise of 5G in 2019 with nearly a month to spare. That coincides with the pre-order of two 5G-enabled handsets. from OnePlus and Samsung. The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition. at least. is a T-Mobile exclusive here in the States.It’s a premium as far as OnePlus goes. but still arrives at the (relatively) low price of $900. Compare that to the $1.300 Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. Both are officially going on sale on Friday. and should be able to connect to the new network at launch.T-Mobile’s clearly being more deliberate in its roll out here. fighting the urge to plant its flag. Instead. the carrier’s network will be available in wider swaths of land versus the competition’s neighborhood to neighborhood approach. And while the network isn’t expected to be as fast as other solutions. it should reach indoors better — a pretty key differentiator.
technology,Amazon debuts automatic speech recognition service. Amazon Transcribe Medical,Amazon  is expanding its automatic transcription service for AWS. Amazon Transcribe. to include support for medical speech. the company announced this morning at its AWS re:Invent conference. The new machine learning-powered service. Amazon Transcribe Medical. will allow physicians to quickly dictate their clinical notes and speech into accurate text in real time. without any human intervention. Amazon claims.Unlike some services. the physicians won’t have to say things like “comma” or “full stop.” but can speak normally during the dictation process. The text can then be fed to downstream systems. including ER systems or AWS language services. like Amazon Comprehend Medical for entity extraction.The service is also HIPAA-eligible and scales with the users’ needs. meaning you’ll only pay for what you actually use and without upfront fees. notes Amazon.From a technical perspective. the service works as follows.You first capture audio through a device’s microphone. then send PCM audio to a streaming API. based on the WebSocket protocol. The API responds with a series of JSON blobs with the transcribed text. plus word-level time stamps and punctuation. This can also be optionally saved to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.
technology,AWS announces DeepComposer. a machine-learning keyboard for developers,Today. as AWS re:Invent begins. Amazon announced DeepComposer. a machine learning-driven keyboard aimed at developers.“AWS DeepComposer is a 32-key. 2-octave keyboard designed for developers to get hands on with Generative AI. with either pretrained models or your own.” AWS’ Julien Simon wrote in a blog post introducing the company’s latest machine learning hardware.The keyboard is supposed to help developers learn about machine learning in a fun way. and maybe create some music along the way. The area involved in generating creative works in artificial intelligence is called “generative AI.” In other words. it helps you teach machines to generate something creative using “generative adversarial networks.”“Developers. regardless of their background in ML or music. can get started with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This Generative AI technique pits two different neural networks against each other to produce new and original digital works based on sample inputs. With AWS DeepComposer. you can train and optimize GAN models to create original music.” according to Amazon.
technology,Reinventing the relationship between workers and tech,A young father and kitchen worker in Pittsburgh was thrilled to get a job with a big restaurant chain that paid $15 an hour — much more than he had been making in fast food.Soon after starting. however. he learned that his schedule was set through an algorithm that crunches a range of data — from weather forecasts to past sales — to predict customer traffic. optimize shifts. and. ultimately. maximize profits. As a result. his hours were extremely unpredictable and sometimes his shifts were cancelled minutes before they were set to start. A job he believed would provide security now barely gave him enough hours to make rent and provide for his family. And it was all because of how his employer used technology.The Pittsburgh worker’s story is not unique
technology,Ikea is helping to redesign simulated Mars habitats,Ikea believes its approach to making small spaces more liveable applies even on other planets: The company has been working with an Earth-based research facility that is meant to mimic what a Mars habitat would be like. according to Fast Company. Originally. Ikea sent a designer to the station to seek inspiration for creating functional furniture for small apartments — but it quickly became a two-way street. which could mean the Swedish home furnishing company has a say in how future human colonists live on other planets.As detailed by FastCo. Ikea designer Christina Levenborn spent time living in the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. which is situated in a desert and designed to feel as close as possible to the experience of living and working on the actual Red Planet. At any given time. there are usually a number of these types of simulated research projects going on. taking crews of volunteers and putting them into a simulated work/life scenario to help us prepare for when astronauts do the real thing. NASA is hoping to begin establishing a more permanent human presence on the Moon by 2024. which means this work could have real-world applications in space sooner rather than later.Levenborn did indeed design an Ikea collection inspired by her time in the habitat. but she and others at Ikea returned the favor as well. coming up with organizational strategies and interior design layouts that emphasized a sense of privacy and personal space even in very cramped quarters. using Ikea shelving units and modular. wheeled furniture for flexibility and tidiness. Warm lighting and outdoor equipment for indoor use also contributed to making the habitat more… well. habitable.

Uncapped  has set out to use various marketing. sales and accounting data to be able to offer finance for young businesses based on their current (and projected) revenue.Specifically. Uncapped says it will enable founders to access working capital between £10.000 and £1 million for a flat fee of 6%. It’s being pitched as a smart alternative for growing companies that don’t want to give away equity in return for capital to help grow.
technology,Millions of SMS messages exposed in database security lapse,A massive database storing tens of millions of SMS  text messages. most of which were sent by businesses to potential customers. has been found online.The database is run by TrueDialog. a business SMS provider for businesses and higher education providers. which lets companies. colleges. and universities send bulk text messages to their customers and students. The Austin. Texas-based company says one of the advantages to its service is that recipients can also text back. allowing them to have two-way conversations with brands or businesses.The database stored years of sent and received text messages from its customers and processed by TrueDialog. But because the database was left unprotected on the internet without a password. none of the data was encrypted and anyone could look inside.Security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar found the exposed database earlier this month as part of their internet scanning efforts.TechCrunch examined a portion of the data. which contained detailed logs of messages sent by customers who used TrueDialog’s system. including phone numbers and SMS message contents. The database contained information about university finance applications. marketing messages from businesses with discount codes. and job alerts. among other things.
technology,Facebook bowed to a Singapore government order to brand a news post as false,Facebook added a correction notice to a post by a fringe news site that Singapore’s government said contained false information. It’s the first time the government has tried to enforce a new law against ‘fake news’ outside its borders.The post by fringe news site States Times Review (STR). contained “scurrilous accusations” according to the Singapore government.The States Times Review post contained accusations about the arrest of an alleged whistleblower and election-rigging.Singapore authorities had previously ordered STR editor Alex Tan to correct the post but the Australian citizen said he would “not comply with any order from a foreign government”.Mr Tan. who was born in Singapore. said he was an Australian citizen living in Australia and was not subject to the law. In a follow-up post. he said he would “defy and resist every unjust law”. He also posted the article on Twitter. LinkedIn and Google Docs and challenged the government to order corrections there as well.On the note Facebook said it “is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information”. They then embedded the note at the bottom of the original post. which was not altered. Only social media users in Singapore could see the note.
technology,Microsoft is Creating a New Rust-Based Programming Language For Secure Coding ,"Under Project Verona. Microsoft is working to make Windows 10 more secure by integrating Mozilla-developed Rust for low-level Windows components. ""'Memory safety' is the term for coding frameworks that help protect memory space from being abused by malware."" reports ZDNet. ""Project Verona at Microsoft is meant to progress the company's work here to close off this attack vector."" From the report:Microsoft's Project Verona could turn out to be just an experiment that leads nowhere. but the company has progressed far enough to have detailed some of its ideas through the UK-based non-profit Knowledge Transfer Network. Matthew Parkinson. a Microsoft researcher from the Cambridge Computer Lab in the UK who's dedicated to ""investigating memory management for managed programming languages."" gave a talk last week focusing on what the company is doing to address these memory issues.In the talk. Parkinson discussed the work Microsoft has done with MemGC. which is short for Memory Garbage Collector. for Internet Explorer (IE) and Edge. MemGC addressed vulnerabilities in the standard browser feature known as a Document Object Model (DOM). a representation of the data used by browsers to interpret web pages. Google's elite Project Zero hackers were impressed with Microsoft's MemGC after canvassing major browsers. [...] The other class of bugs Microsoft is working on to address relates to uninitialized memory in a way that also doesn't kill performance. [...] Parkinson said Microsoft is rewriting some ""targeted"" components in Rust. His talk focused on language design and compartmentalization. ""If we want compartments. and to carve up the legacy bits of our code so [attackers'] exploit code can't get out. what do we need in the language design that can help with that?"" This is Project Verona and Parkinson said it was the first time he'd discussed the project. which will be made open source ""soon"". It is a new language for what Microsoft is calling ""safe infrastructure programming.""""The challenge for Microsoft is dealing with the 'application spectrum.' which spans from C# for desktop apps through to C and C# for Exchange. ASP.NET. Azure. and device drivers. to deep Windows components like memory management and boot loaders and the Windows kernel hardware abstraction layer (HAL)."" the report says."
technology,Vulnerability In Fully Patched Android Phones Under Active Attack By Bank Thieves,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica:A vulnerability in millions of fully patched Android phones is being actively exploited by malware that's designed to drain the bank accounts of infected users. researchers said on Monday. The vulnerability allows malicious apps to masquerade as legitimate apps that targets have already installed and come to trust. researchers from security firm Promon reported in a post. Running under the guise of trusted apps already installed. the malicious apps can then request permissions to carry out sensitive tasks. such as recording audio or video. taking photos. reading text messages or phishing login credentials. Targets who click yes to the request are then compromised.Researchers with Lookout. a mobile security provider and a Promon partner. reported last week that they found 36 apps exploiting the spoofing vulnerability. The malicious apps included variants of the BankBot banking trojan. BankBot has been active since 2017. and apps from the malware family have been caught repeatedly infiltrating the Google Play Market. The vulnerability is most serious in versions 6 through 10. which account for about 80% of Android phones worldwide. Attacks against those versions allow malicious apps to ask for permissions while posing as legitimate apps. There's no limit to the permissions these malicious apps can seek. Access to text messages. photos. the microphone. camera. and GPS are some of the permissions that are possible. A user's only defense is to click ""no"" to the requests.""The vulnerability is found in a function known as TaskAffinity. a multitasking feature that allows apps to assume the identity of other apps or tasks running in the multitasking environment."" reports Ars Technica. While Google has removed the [unnamed] malicious apps from its Play Store. according to Promon. the vulnerability is still unfixed in all versions of Android."

The report. which rates the world's 35 biggest insurers on their actions on fossil fuels. declares that coal -- the biggest single contributor to climate change -- ""is on the way to becoming uninsurable"" as most coal projects cannot be financed. built or operated without insurance.Ten firms moved to restrict the insurance cover they offer to companies that build or operate coal power plants in 2019. taking the global total to 17. said the Unfriend Coal campaign. which includes 13 environmental groups such as Greenpeace. Client Earth and Urgewald. a German NGO. The report will be launched at an insurance and climate risk conference in London on Monday. as the UN climate summit gets underway in Madrid. The first insurers to exit coal policies were all European. but since March. two U.S. insurers -- Chubb and Axis Capital -- and the Australian firms QBE and Suncorp have pledged to stop or restrict insurance for coal projects. At least 35 insurers with combined assets of $8.9 trillion. equivalent to 37% of the insurance industry's global assets. have begun pulling out of coal investments. A year ago. 19 insurers holding more than $6 trillion in assets were divesting from fossil fuels."

Streaming services have made in-roads into a number of major categories of video entertainment. including TV shows and movies.In a measure of how big streaming has become. Wells Fargo Securities wrote that between November 17-23. “The Mandalorian.” a series from Disney+ set in the “Star Wars” universe. was the “most in-demand show in OTT and overall on a linear+OTT basis.” OTT stands for “over the top” content. which bypasses cable boxes. Linear TV airs at set times. as opposed to being on-demand. as with streaming. The firm cited data from Parrot Analytics in its report. which was dated Nov. 29.
technology,'Grinch bots' are here to ruin your holiday shopping,Consumers may think they’re avoiding the crush this holiday season by shopping online. unaware that as they’re trying to get through the digital doors. so too are hordes of bots. And they’re throwing elbows.Up to 97 percent of all online traffic to retailer login pages this holiday shopping week comes from bots. largely operated by organized gangs of cybercriminals. according to estimates by cybersecurity firm Radware.The bots fill out online forms and navigate retail sites faster than a real person can. and try to swiftly purchase limited supply gifts before you’ve even filled up your cart. The items are then sold for a higher price on third-party sites. The cyber thieves also crack into accounts. drain accounts of rewards and other digital currency. conduct credit card fraud. and more. said Ron Winward. a Radware spokesman.“Website operators are seeing uptick in bot activity leading up to Cyber Monday from people trying out their bots.” said Winward. “People are really competing with automated infrastructure and bots to get hot holiday items.”
technology,Portland plans to propose the strictest facial recognition ban in the country,As the federal government plods along on developing privacy laws. some cities are taking matters into their own hands—with facial recognition technology at the top of the list. Now. Portland. Oregon. has plans to ban the use of facial recognition for both the government and private businesses in the city. a move that could make Portland’s ban the most restrictive in the United States.The proposed ban comes after cities including San Francisco. Oakland. and Berkeley in California. and Somerville in Massachusetts. have already banned the use of facial recognition by their city government agencies. including police departments. But Portland’s ban goes a step further by expanding to private businesses—if it makes it into law and takes effect in spring 2020. as planned.It could be a preview of what to expect across the country. “I think we’re going to start to see more and more [private sector bans].” says ACLU of Northern California attorney Matt Cagle. who helped draft the San Francisco legislation that later served as the model for Oakland and Berkeley. “People are really concerned about facial recognition use and the tracking of their innate features by governments and private corporations.”Along with being used in policing. facial recognition is becoming a fixture in retail stores. stadiums. and even schools. Software providers like Microsoft. Amazon. and IBM offer algorithms that any developer can use to analyze faces. and other big companies like Facebook have already implemented facial recognition on social media.
technology,Archivists Are Trying to Make Sure a ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ Never Goes Down,It’s hard to find free and open access to scientific material online. The latest studies and current research huddle behind paywalls unread by those who could benefit. But over the last few years. two sites—Library Genesis and Sci-Hub—have become high-profile. widely used resources for pirating scientific papers.The problem is that these sites have had a lot of difficulty actually staying online. They have faced both legal challenges and logistical hosting problems that has knocked them offline for long periods of time. But a new project by data hoarders and freedom of information activists hopes to bring some stability to one of the two “Pirate Bays of Science.”Library Genesis (LibGen) contains 33 terabytes of books. scientific papers. comics. and more in its scientific library. That’s a lot of data to host when countries and science publishers are constantly trying to get you shut down.Last week. redditors launched a project to better seed. or host. LibGen's files.“It's the largest free library in the world. servicing tens of thousands of scientists and medical professionals around the world who live in developing countries that can't afford to buy books and scientific journals. There's almost nothing else like this on Earth. They're using torrents to fulfill World Health Organization and U.N. charters. And it's not just one site index—it's a network of mirrored sites. where a new one pops up every time another gets taken down.” user shrine said on Reddit. Shrine is helping to start the project.
