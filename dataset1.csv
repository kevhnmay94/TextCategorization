science,NASA’s Curiosity Rover Snaps Another Stunning ‘Selfie’ On Mars,NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover just loves a good selfie. The car-sized explorer took time out from its busy sand scooping and sieving schedule to snap yet another self-portrait on Mars. The spectacular image — perhaps the ultimate humble brag — is a composite of 57 photographs it took of itself by the Red Planet’s Namib Dune on Jan. 19. NASA scientists used its Mars Hand Lens Imagers camera at the end of its arm to snap the shot. As the image is a composite. only part of the arm is visible. The selfie. which NASA released on Friday. is at least the third that Curiosity has beamed back to Earth since first landing on the planet on Aug. 6. 2012. In August 2015. it sent back a 92-image composite selfie after drilling a rock nicknamed “Buckskin” in the Marias Pass area. Meanwhile. in June 2014. it snapped a self-portrait to celebrate being on Mars for exactly one full Martian year — the equivalent of 687 Earth days. The explorer’s initial mission was to “determine whether Mars once offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.” For the last two months. it’s investigated active sand dunes and how the wind moves on the Bagnold Dune Field lining the northwestern flank of the planet’s Mount Sharp. “The mission’s examination of active sand dunes — the first ever studied up close other than on Earth — is providing information about active dune processes in conditions with much less atmosphere and less gravity than on Earth.” NASA revealed in a statement. “Researchers are evaluating possible sites for the next use of Curiosity’s drill to collect rock-powder samples of the bedrock in the area.” the space agency added.
science,NASA Video Gives A Tour Of The Moon (VIDEO),Don’t have $155 million to buy a ticket to the moon? Worry not. because NASA’s got the next best thing: a video tour of it free of charge! In the video. a narrator highlights key features including craters. astronaut trails. and the mysterious far side of the moon. “Altough the moon has remained largely unchanged during human history. our understanding of it and how it has evolved over time has evolved dramatically.” the video’s info section states. “Thanks to new measurements. we have new and unprecedented views of its surface. along with new insight into how it and other rocky planets in our solar system came to look the way they do.” Back in February. NASA’s twin Grail probes used a camera. called MoonKam. took the world’s first-ever video footage of the far side of the moon. The video was taken primarily as an educational project for middle schoolers. but reveals ground breaking images of the rugged terrain. CORRECTION: a previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the far side of the moon as the dark side of the moon. and stated the moon was a “planet.”
science,This Machine Will Create The Largest Manmade Waves In The World,Here comes the wave! Scientists at Deltares. a research institute in the Netherlands. say that they have created a machine that can produce the largest human-made waves in the world. Science magazine reports. The enormous model is called the Delta Flume. The water-filled trough is approximately 984 feet long and 16 feet across. and its walls are 31 feet high. The magazine explains how it works: At one end sits a gigantic metal plate called a wave board. four pistons move it back and forth to whip up the kind of waves that the sea can unleash. The waves travel along the flume and crash onto whatever researchers have built at the other end—which could include a novel type of dike. an artificial sand dune or gravel beach. or a pylon used to hold up an offshore wind turbine. So far. the machine has topped out at an 18-foot wave. but researchers hope to go higher. The machine cost approximately $30 million to construct. and can contain up to 2.400.000 gallons of water. the BBC reports. Researchers say they will test “wave heights. wave pressures and forces. flow velocities. wave overtopping. damage patterns and changes in cross-sections.” They will be able to analyze large water movements as well as smaller ones. between rocks. for example. Findings could lead to new strategies for shoreline protection.
science,Alien Planets May Shed Light On Climate Change On Earth. Scientists Say,A Comparative Climatology Symposium held at NASA Headquarters on May 7 focused on new approaches to climate research by highlighting the similarities and contrasts between the environments of the rocky worlds Venus. Earth. Mars and Saturn’s smoggy moon Titan. The symposium also included discussions about exoplanets. the sun and past. present and future space missions. John Grunsfeld. Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. said that the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will be able to make important observations of the atmospheres of exoplanets. He said JWST won’t be able to locate the exoplanets. only study them. but the recently selected TESS mission could act as a planet scout for JWST targets. It is estimated that TESS will discover around 300 “super-Earth” alien planets. many of them in the habitable zone. But the number one challenge. Grunsfeld noted. is figuring out the climate of our own planet.
science,Is a Self-Aware Robot Like Chappie Possible?,I was fortunate enough to be invited to a screening and press conference for the movie Chappie. It is a great movie about a police robot named Chappie that is downloaded with a program that makes him self-aware. At the press conference. Neill Blomkamp. the director. script writer. and the guy who came up with the idea for the movie. said he wasn’t sure if humanity could ever produce the type of artificial intelligence (AI) in Chappie. I was curious if that was possible myself. In order to answer that question. I was able to interview the founder and director of the Visual and Autonomous Exploration Systems Research Laboratory at Caltech and at the University of Arizona. Dr. Wolfgang Fink. He is working on building an autonomous “ planetary field geologist” robot for NASA.
science,Scientists Discover Thousands Of Uncharted Mountains Hidden Beneath The Sea,A new topographic map of Earth’s mysterious ocean floor reveals thousands of towering volcanoes. hidden gashes where supercontinents ripped apart and other never-before-seen features once veiled by miles of water and thick sediment. The topography of Earth’s seafloor is as corrugated and bumpy as a book set in Braille. By reading these peaks and ridges. scientists can chronicle the birth of new ocean crust and the past wanderings of Earth’s continents. However. even though the seafloor carries the pivotal clues to plate tectonics. the dry surface of Mars has been detailed more clearly than the ocean’s watery depths. The new map. released today (Oct. 2) in the journal Science. promises to fill in some of the blanks. Compared with the previous map. from 1997. the resolution is twice as accurate overall and four times as better in coastal areas and the Arctic. said lead study author David Sandwell. a marine geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. California.
science,This Orbiting ‘Pac-Man’ May Help Solve The Space Junk Problem,There’s a lot of stuff floating around the Earth. including dangerous space junk. In fact. more than 500.000 pieces of debris — from defunct satellites and tools that drifted away during spacewalks to even frozen droplets of urine — are orbiting our planet. The junk poses a huge collision-risk to current and future space missions. And now. scientists have proposed a new way to clean up all of that trash. Researchers from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne have proposed what they are calling the Clean Space One Project to remove debris from orbit by using a “Pac-Man” satellite. What is that? Well. the satellite looks like this. When it encounters space debris. it acts like this.
science,Pretty Much Every Living Thing Is Already Feeling The Effects Of Climate Change,Climate change has already touched almost all life on the planet. even under moderate rates of global warming. according to a report published Thursday in the journal Science. An international team of researchers found 82 percent of key biological processes necessary for healthy ecosystems had been impacted by the phenomenon. The changes have been felt even though the world is just 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. “We’re already seeing salamanders shrink in size. we’re seeing migratory birds change their migratory routes. we’re seeing species interbreeding now. because of just a small degree of warming.” said James Watson. a professor at the University of Queensland and senior author of the report. Scientists are currently gathered in Marrakech. Morocco. to work out details of the landmark Paris climate agreement. which aims to keep the world from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. Anything hotter than that will likely cause a slew of troubling events: melting glaciers. rising seas. extreme weather and an uptick in disease. But aside from severe impacts for humanity. those shifts will drastically change worldwide biology.
science,James Webb Space Telescope Will Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before,Move over. Hubble Telescope ― there’s a new BIG scope coming to town. When the $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope is launched in 2018. after two decades of planning and construction. it will bring the deepest and farthest reaches of the physical universe much closer to observers on Earth than anything previously could. In fact. it will take astronomers all the way back in time to the beginning of the physical universe. Named after former NASA administrator James Webb. this next-generation telescope ― generally referred to as JWST or Webb ― “will study every phase in the history of our universe. ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang. to watching galaxies collide. to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth.” according to a NASA statement. “We are opening up a whole new territory of astronomy. We will see things that we’ve never been able to see before because this telescope is much more powerful than even the great Hubble Telescope.” Nobel prize-winning NASA astrophysicist John Mather said in a statement. But wait! What about the Hubble Telescope? Is it being junked or put out to very deep space pasture? After nearly three decades of photographing incredible outer space imagery. Hubble will continue that job. remaining near Earth. While Webb will be a much more powerful outer space observatory. it will not be close to Earth. where ― as history has shown us ― Hubble has required humans to make “on-site” repairs to keep it functioning. No. Webb will be on its own. in an orbit around the sun. Here’s an illustration of the size difference between Hubble and Webb’s imaging mirrors.
science,Space Station Astronauts Return To Earth Sunday From ISS. NASA Says,Three astronauts living on the International Space Station will return home to Earth Sunday (July 1) after spending more than six months in orbit. NASA astronaut Don Pettit. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers are scheduled to undock from the space station in their Russian-built Soyuz capsule at 12:48 a.m. EDT (0448 GMT) Sunday. The trio is expected to land at 4:14 a.m. EDT (0814 GMT) Sunday on the Central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan. “When a frontier feels like home. it is no longer a frontier. it has become “civilization.” Those determined to wander must now pack their bags and move further into the cosmos.” Pettit wrote in a blog post about his upcoming journey home. “Space station is very much on the frontier. It is only my temporary home. and now it is time for me to venture back to my real home.” Throughout their mission. Pettit and Kuipers have actively shared their orbital experiences with the public through Twitter. photos and blog posts. Pettit even penned a special poem. called “Last Day in Space.” to commemorate his imminent return. During their stint at the space station. Pettit. Kononenko and Kuipers also played host to the first ever visiting commercial spacecraft in May — SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. The unmanned Dragon spacecraft was launched to the orbiting outpost as part of a crucial test flight to demonstrate its ability to haul cargo to and from the station. As the robotic spacecraft approached the orbiting complex. Pettit and Kuipers used the space station’s robotic arm to manually attach it to the outpost. SpaceX holds a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for 12 robotic cargo delivery flights. Pettit. Kononenko and Kuipers launched into space on Dec. 21. 2011. and arrived at the orbiting laboratory two days later. The spaceflyers began their stay as members of the station’s Expedition 30 crew. but kicked off Expedition 31 with the departure of three previous station residents in April. Kononenko served as commander of Expedition 31. but will pass the post on to fellow Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka in an official change-of-command ceremony Saturday (June 30). prior to his departure. Padalka arrived at the space station in mid-May with NASA astronaut Joe Acaba and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Revin. The three will remain aboard the orbiting outpost until September. They will be joined by three more crewmembers later in July.
science,Scientists Take Huge Step Toward Universal Flu Vaccine,A universal flu vaccine — one that provides immunity against every strain of the influenza virus for multiple years — is the holy grail of flu research. It would be a medical breakthrough on the order of penicillin. with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives every year. And scientists just got one crucial step closer to making it a reality. Two separate groups of scientists published papers this week demonstrating that a new type of flu vaccine can provide protection against multiple strains of the disease. rather than just one. Though a truly universal flu vaccine that could be given to humans remains years away. infectious disease experts hailed the new findings as a major breakthrough.
science,Here’s How Rats End Up In Toilet Bowls,If you don’t like rats. you might want to sit down for this — but maybe don’t sit on the toilet. Intrigued by the question of how rats make it into toilet bowls (and yes. it does happen). National Geographic put together this brief video tracing the rodents’ paths from street to sewer. sewer to indoor plumbing and. ultimately. into the toilet. Perhaps the most incredible part is how easily a rat can navigate the sharp 180-degree U-turn within the actual toilet pipes. all while underwater. Per National Geographic. rats are naturally strong swimmers and can tread water for three straight days. paddling underwater with their back legs while the front paws steer. They can also hold their breath for up to three minutes. Rats also have unique ribs that flex around joints along their spines. the video notes. This allows the creatures to compress their ribcages to fit through small openings. thereby navigating pipes with ease. Of course. rats take advantage of far easier routes into houses as well. According to the New York State Department of Health. the rodents can even squeeze through the quarter-inch gap underneath a door. 
science,Evidence For Universe Inflation Theory May Lurk In New Data From Planck Space Probe,At first. there was nothing — complete and utter emptiness. Zero energy and zero matter. And then. out of this nothingness. the universe was born. Tiny. but extremely dense and packed with energy. And then. within a miniscule fraction of a second. it rapidly grew in size — inflated — by at least a factor of 10raised to the 25th power. This theory. known as inflation. is currently the dominant explanation for what happened after the Big Bang and for how the universe came to be the way it is today. But although many scientists now believe that inflation did indeed take place. they still don’t know how or why it started. or how it stopped. And so far. there hasn’t been any solid experimental evidence for this accelerated expansion. Scientists hope that in just a few months they might start to unravel the riddle. when they examine the next set of data from the Planck satellite. Since 2009. this radio telescope. run by the European Space Agency (ESA). has been mapping the oldest light in the universe. Known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). this fossil light is often called the Big Bang’s afterglow. It is thought to have appeared after the inflationary period. some 380.000 years after the universe was born. when neutral atoms started forming and space became transparent to light. When the first set of Planck data was released in March 2013. both “inflationists” and “anti-inflationists” felt vindicated. 
science,How Early-Life Stress Could Increase Risk Of Anxiety And Depression Later In Life,The trillions of organisms living in your digestive tract can literally change the way your brain works. Scientists continue to find more and more evidence of the significant influence of gut bacteria on mental health. Studies have linked gut bacteria imbalances to a host of health issues. including depression. anxiety. autism and Alzheimer’s disease. and research has also suggested that a healthy microbiome can contribute to a healthy brain and good mood. These issues can be activated at a very young age. New research suggests that a stressful childhood might set you up for gut dysfunction and mental health issues down the road. In a study on mice. which was published this week in the journal Nature Communications. researchers from McMaster University in Canada showed that early-life stress can lead to imbalances in the gut microbiome and contribute to the development of anxiety and depression. “Early life stress changes the composition and metabolic activity of bacteria in the gut.” the study’s lead author. Dr. Premysl Bercik. a professor of gastroenterology at the university’s medical school. told The Huffington Post in an email. “We postulate that this change is due to altered gut function induced by stress.”
science,New Map Of The Brain Identifies 97 Previously Unknown Areas,If you ask a neuroscientist to show you a map of the brain. chances are they’ll pick one that’s more than a century old. In 1909. a German anatomist named Korbinian Brodmann published an intricate map of the brain’s surface. He painstakingly stained brain cells of many kinds to find the anatomical features that set them apart and the rules that governed their layered organization. We now know that neurons that sense a touch on the skin are found in Brodmann area 1. those allowing you to read this article sit in area 17. Now. scientists have built an updated map of the brain that further refines those areas. Published Wednesday in the journal Nature. the map reveals 97 previously unknown areas of the brain’s surface (the cortex). in addition to 83 areas that were described before.
science,Brain & Obesity: Neural Implant Could Curb Overeating. Mouse Study Suggests,The brain may not seem like an obvious place to look for possible treatments for obesity. but researchers say implanting a device that stimulates a specific region of the brain may help curb the compulsion to overeat. The new study on obese mice found that deep brain stimulation (DBS). which involves implanting a device that sends electrical impulses to precise targets in the brain. may reduce binge eating and other obesity-related behaviors. “Once replicated in human clinical trials. DBS could rapidly become a treatment for people with obesity due to the extensive groundwork already established in other disease areas.” lead author Casey Halpern. a resident in the department of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. said in a statement.
science,‘Seven Sisters’ Star Cluster Distance Revealed In Most Accurate Measurement Yet,Super-bright galaxies powered by black holes have helped astronomers come up with the most accurate distance yet to the iconic Pleiades star cluster. The measurement. which used quasars as bright and consistent relative-distance markers. charted the famous “Seven Sisters” star cluster at 136.2 parsecs. or 444 light-years. away from Earth. Lead researcher Carl Melis first took on the project five years ago while still in graduate school at the University of California. Los Angeles. after meeting with John Stauffer (a co-author on the paper). Melis recalled being astounded to learn there was a dispute over how far away the Pleiades are from Earth. “Here’s this canonical cluster — everyone knows the Pleiades. even the layperson — and we don’t even know how far away it is.” Melis. who is now an astrophysicist at the University of California. San Diego. told Space.com.

NASA astronauts Michael Smith. Dick Scobee. Judith Resnik. Ronald McNair. Ellison Onizuka. Gregory Jarvis and school teacher Christa McAuliffe died after a booster engine failed and the shuttle broke apart just 73 seconds after takeoff.
science,Why Nature Can Flourish In War Zones,War often devastates natural environments — bombs and bullets can destroy forests. kill animals and contaminate rivers. But human conflict has also protected natural areas. according to conservation biologist Dr. Thor Hanson. “It’s an unexpected finding in some ways.” the author of The Triumph of Seeds. told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “But it makes logical sense.” This is because biodiversity can rebound in areas where fighting has reduced human activity. he explained. The most striking example of a war’s conserving power might be the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The area commonly known as the DMZ was set up in 1953 after the Korean War to mark the boundary between the two East Asian countries. Although it represents a bloody gash in the region’s history. the zone is now remarkably biodiverse. Hanson said. “You have several kilometer-wide strip going from coast to coast that is depopulated.” he said. “There’s a de facto park between those counties. all sorts of species are thriving there that have disappeared outside that area.”
science,Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster Marks 26th Anniversary,On January. 28. 1986. the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off from launch pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Florida. The shocking accident - broadcast live on television - claimed the lives of all seven crew members. including Christa McAuliffe. a Concord. N.H. school teacher who had been selected to inaugurate NASA’s highly publicized Teacher In Space Project. Later that day. President Reagan returned to the airwaves to console a grieving nation. He reserved a few words specifically for the schoolchildren who had been watching. “I know it is hard to understand. but sometimes painful things like this happen.” he said. “It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted. it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future. and we’ll continue to follow them.” The shuttle program was grounded for almost three years following the accident. During that time investigators worked to pinpoint and correct the causes of the explosion - notably a failed “O-ring” gasket in the shuttle’s booster rockets that allowed superheated gases to ignite fuel inside an external tank. Twenty-six years have passed since Challenger disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean. and the shuttle program itself is now history. But those who watched the disaster can never forget seeing the shuttle’s elegant arc abruptly give way to twisted white contrails and falling debris. And even now few events loom as large in the nation’s space lore.
science,Solar Plasma Wave Larger Than Earth Erupted October 19. Solar Dynamics Observatory Reports,A giant wave of super-hot solar plasma larger than the Earth erupted from the sun on Friday (Oct. 19) in a spectacular display captured by a NASA spacecraft. The huge solar prominence occurred at 4:15 a.m. EDT (0815 GMT) and was recorded in amazing detail by the high-definition cameras aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory before escaping the sun. “Once it started breaking away. the process only took 10 hours before it was out of sight.” NASA media specialist Steele Hill explained in a photo description. “The prominence stretched out many times the size of Earth.” The Solar Dynamics Observatory showed the solar prominence as a wispy red-orange wave stretching out from the lower right section of the sun. The image was recorded in the 304 Angstrom wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light. according to Hill. Prominences are eruptions of charged solar plasma that appear to arc out away from the sun’s edge. or limb. in spacecraft and telescope views. The structures are shaped by extreme magnetic field. Some loop-like prominences are short-lived. lasting only a few minutes. Others can be more stable. lasting hours or days. NASA scientists have said in the past. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory is one of several spacecraft keeping a constant watch on the sun to track major solar flares. eruptions other space weather events. The sun is currently in an active phase of its 11-year solar weather cycle and is expected to reach its peak activity in 2013. The current solar weather cycle is known as Solar Cycle 24. The Solar Dynamics Observatory has been tracing the sun’s weather activity since the probe’s launch in 2010.

But now new research suggests there’s another big benefit — it just may boost your metabolism. Researchers have found that cool temperatures can stimulate the growth of brown fat. a special kind of fat that burns energy. in your body — which may boost your metabolic health and may protect against obesity and diabetes.
science,Stranger Than Science... Or Is It?,Rocks from the sky: Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni is usually called the father of meteoritics. In 1794 he published a book that declared that not only are meteors stones that fall from the sky. but they originally come from space. After a spectacular fireball and meteorite recovery in Weston. Connecticut. in December 1807. Thomas Jefferson. then the president of the United States. responded with great skepticism: “Gentlemen. I would rather believe that two Yankee professors would lie than believe that stones fall from heaven.” By the late 1800s meteorites were established science thanks to studies of a number of meteor falls. The first time an impact theory was proposed was in 1891. but even by the 1950s there were still many scientists who doubted this proposal. even to explain the craters on the Moon. In 1963 geologist Eugene Shoemaker became the first scientist to prove conclusively that the famous Barringer Crater in Arizona is actually a meteor impact crater caused by the explosion following an impact. and not a caldera or volcanic steam vent.

Physicists at the University of Rochester have found a way to make metal so resistant to water that any droplets that fall on it simply bounce off like tiny basketballs. Apart from being freaky to watch in action. the first-of-its kind material may have important applications—from making better devices for collecting rainwater in water-scarce developing countries. to improving the sanitation of toilets. to making airplane wings and solar panels resistant to rusting or icing over. How did the scientists create this seemingly magical material? They used a powerful laser to etch minute micro- and nanoscale patterns onto brass. titanium. and platinum.

But are we now losing our primacy in space? Half of Americans think so. according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. But many think the country should rely more on private companies — not the government — for future space missions. According to the poll. 50 percent of Americans think the U.S. is losing its leadership role in space exploration. while 30 percent think it’s maintaining its status as a world leader. 
science,Why Mars Can Be Affordable And Achievable,Why should humans venture to Mars? In some sense. it is to fulfill a longing in our collective psyche. Humanity has dreamed of walking on Mars since travel above the Earth’s surface became feasible... Those dreams seemed to be on the verge of being realized with the dawn of the Space Age in the mid-20th Century. but for decades Mars remained out of reach to human explorers on site. That frustrating situation has resulted in what many have come to see as Mars being perpetually “20 years away.” In the terminology used for space launches. we have been in a “hold” for the past 30 years. Today. however. we can finally say that the countdown clock is running. We are going to Mars. twenty years and counting! If we stay the course. the first humans will set foot on the Red Planet by the year 2033. New technologies have become available that have allowed us to take a fresh look at how to approach human Mars missions and. as a result. to tackle the hardest technical problems that had previously led to a hold in the countdown. And these approaches have given us the ability to design an architecture that can be brought on line incrementally. which keeps the annual expenditures within a reasonable projected NASA human spaceflight budget.
science,‘Star Trek’ May Inspire Names For Pluto’s Craters. Mountains. & Other Features (PHOTOS),While the naming gods have swatted away an attempt to christen one of Pluto’s newfound moons “Vulcan.” the “Star Trek” universe may still leave its mark on the dwarf planet soon enough. After NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft gets the first up-close views of Pluto in 2015. craters. mountains and other features spotted on the dwarf planet’s surface could bear the names of famous “Star Trek” characters. researchers said. “We might have craters called Sulu and Spock and Kirk and McCoy and so on.” Mark Showalter of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View. Calif.. said during a Google+ Hangout today (July 2). Showalter led the team that used NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope to discover Pluto’s two smallest known moons. which were announced in 2011 and 2012 with the pedestrian names P4 and P5. respectively. P4 is thought to be 8 to 21 miles (13 to 34 kilometers) wide. while P5 is tinier still at 6 to 15 miles (10 to 25 km) across.
science,Giant Artwork Reflects The Gorgeous Complexity of The Human Brain,Your brain has approximately 86 billion neurons joined together through some 100 trillion connections. giving rise to a complex biological machine capable of pulling off amazing feats. Yet it’s difficult to truly grasp the sophistication of this interconnected web of cells. Now. a new work of art based on actual scientific data provides a glimpse into this complexity. The 8-by-12-foot gold panel. depicting a sagittal slice of the human brain. blends hand drawing and multiple human brain datasets from several universities. The work was created by Greg Dunn. a neuroscientist-turned-artist. and Brian Edwards. a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. and goes on display Saturday at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. There will be a public unveiling and a lecture by the artists at 3 p.m. “The human brain is insanely complicated.” Dunn said. “Rather than being told that your brain has 80 billion neurons. you can see with your own eyes what the activity of 500.000 of them looks like. and that has a much greater capacity to make an emotional impact than does a factoid in a book someplace.”

science,When Concerned Scientists Cause Concern,I have spent the last seven years witnessing the perils and attempting to understand the science behind fracking. the unconventional new kind of fracking that in terms of scale far supersedes the oil and gas extraction methods employed over the past half century. As a Special Assistant to former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell I became all too familiar with the seriously negative implications fracking has had on individuals and communities across the width and breadth of the Commonwealth. where under our watch the state engaged in fracking frenzy.

science,Olympics In Space? Astronauts To Hold Own ‘Summer Games’,To mark the upcoming Olympic Games in London. a crew of astronauts due to launch to the space station this summer is planning an orbital sporting event for the occasion. NASA astronaut Sunita (Suni) Williams. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency spaceflyer Akihiko Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko are due to launch July 14 to the International Space Station. Their planned four-month stay in space will overlap with the London 2012 Olympics July 27 to Aug. 12. so the sporty spaceflyers have something up their sleeves to celebrate the event. “Something unique about our increment is we have a very huge sports event during our increment. so what we’re talking about amongst ourselves is. why don’t we do some kind of sports event onboard the station too?” Hoshide told reporters during a NASA preview the mission. “We’re just tossing around ideas right now. what kind of sport event we can do. That’s something I’m looking forward to.”
science,We Need Scientific Integrity In Cannabis Policy,In 2014. the New England Journal of Medicine ran a propaganda piece by Dr. Nora Volkow. the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) titled Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use. The article is occasionally referenced by neo-prohibitionists to demonstrate the position of the federal government that cannabis has no known medical use in the United States. This position is beyond absurd. it is dangerous to both public health and the role of science in the public square. Medical cannabis is legal in over half of the states in the union. Tincture of cannabis (Sativex) is legal to prescribe in 24 countries. The congressionally mandated mission of NIDA is to fund studies that are designed to demonstrate negative aspects of psychoactive drugs (including cannabis). but not the positive aspects of their effect on the human body.
science,Sneezes Travel A Lot Farther On Airplanes Than You Might Think,A new computer simulation (above) shows the yucky truth about the spread of potentially infectious germs when someone sneezes on a crowded airliner. “The particles are colored to show you where the stuff goes.” Robert Harwood of Ansys. the Canonsburg. Pennsylvania-based engineering firm that created the video. told Popular Science. “Those droplets get picked up by the airflow and get transplanted all over the cabin. They actually spread quite far.”
science,You’re Not a Chimpanzee. So Don’t Make Love Like One,Why do people have sex the way they do? There are lots of puzzling things about that. but three really stand out. Sex between two chimpanzees takes a few seconds. but sex between humans can take hours. Why are we so different from them? Men can only have a few orgasms. but women can have lots of orgasms. separated by long intervals of high arousal. Why are we so different from each other? And finally. surveys done by people like Shere Hite and Alfred Kinsey have consistently shown that intercourse isn’t really the easiest way for many women to have an orgasm. [3] Oral sex and masturbation often work better. But why wouldn’t the activity that leads to fertilization be the most reliably pleasurable one? And why do we humans engage in so many other sexual activities. from anal sex to zoophilia. that also have nothing to do with reproduction? To answer these questions. we’d need to know how our human way of having sex evolved. But there’s no generally accepted theory. Ten years ago. Elizabeth Lloyd’s explanation of the female orgasm looked pretty plausible [5]. She argued that women can have many orgasms simply because there never was any reason for a limit to evolve. They have nothing to do with reproduction. They’re just an evolutionary accident.

science,Could You Outrun A Fart? Here’s What The Science Says,You can run but you can’t hide. When a fart detonates. you face a difficult race to avoid its impact. according to a new video (above) that was released by the YouTube series AsapScience on Wednesday. Escaping the sound is out of the question. At around 340 meters per second. the sound can travel hundreds of meters per second faster than Olympic sprint champ Usain Bolt. according to the video. But as for your chances of beating the stink. well. you can try. According to the new video. the stinky emissions in the farts can be quite swift. Skatole. one of the rank compounds found in a fart. can speed through the air with intimidating velocity under certain conditions. “If we use the kinetic theory of gases. assume that the fart is at body temperature. and then we plug in the molar mass of skatole. we calculate that the smelliest skatole may be traveling around 243 meters per second.” Mitchell Moffit. narrator and co-creator of the series. says in the video. And there doesn’t have to be a lot of it to stop you in your tracks. It turns out that only around 1 percent of a fart consists of chemicals that produce the putrid scent. however. they’re so powerful that most people can smell them at levels of 1 part per 100 million parts of air. according to the website Science Dump. But we say make a run for it anyway. Even if you don’t win. it’s still exercise.
science,There’s A Good Chance Your Brain Will Fall For This Color Trick,Focus on the green dot and you just might learn something. Your brain is pretty remarkable when it comes to deciphering colors. but it does have the ability to play tricks on you. This video from the folks at AsapSCIENCE demonstrates the effect of afterimaging. which happens when the cones in your eyes become fatigued as their supply of photopigment is exhausted and photo signals to the brain halt. After a quick color test. the video proceeds to a crash course on all things color and your brain. Why do bananas appear yellow? Why are plants green. but not flowers? Is the color on your computer screen really what you think it is? Check out the video above to find out.
science,Is Obamacare Punishing Hospitals The Wrong Way?,An elderly homeless man is admitted to the emergency room complaining of a fever and cough. Doctors take an X-ray and diagnose him with pneumonia. They keep him in the hospital for three days while he takes antibiotics and recovers. Then they discharge him. telling him to continue taking the antibiotics for another week. He takes only half his pills and the disease returns. so he checks back into the hospital. Who’s to blame? According to the federal government. the hospital is. Under the Affordable Care Act. hospitals are fined up to 3 percent of their Medicare payments if too many Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. By giving hospitals a financial incentive to reduce readmissions. the idea is to encourage better quality care.

Enhance Brain’s Ability To Form Long-Term Memories,In the film “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” the characters undergo a scientific procedure to erase their memory. But what if instead of erasing memory. you could restore it? One neuroscientist aims to do just that. Theodore Berger of the University of Southern California is developing a prosthesis to restore memory. by replacing a circuit in the brain’s hippocampus. Berger described the device at the Global Future 2045 International Congress. held here June 15-16. Already successful in rats and monkeys. the prosthesis is now being tested in humans.

science,NASA Mars Rover ‘Curiosity’ Closing In On Red Planet To Seek Life Clues,NASA’s Mars rover was on its final approach to the red planet on Sunday. heading toward a mountain that may hold clues about whether life has ever existed on Mars. officials said. The rover. also known as Curiosity. has been careening toward Mars since its launch in November. The nuclear-powered rover the size of a compact car is expected to end its 352-million-mile (567-million-km) journey on Aug. 6 at 1:31 a.m. EDT (0531 GMT). The landing zone is a 12-mile-by-4-mile (20-km-by-7-km) area inside an ancient impact basin known as Gale Crater. located near the planet’s equator. The crater. one of the lowest places on Mars. has a 3-mile-high (5-km-high) mountain of what appears to be layers of sediment. Scientists suspect the crater may have once been the floor of a lake. If so. they believe that sediments likely filled the crater. but were carried away over time. leaving only the central mound.
science,Rats Sniff Each Other To Assert Dominance. Study Suggests,Without being able to talk to each other. rats use sniffing as one way to answer key questions about strangers. Is that a female? Can I mate with her? Is this one sick? What did he eat? — All of this information can be learned through odor cues. But new research shows that the act of sniffing itself might serve its own social function. allowing rats to reaffirm their hierarchical status and maintain order. Daniel Wesson. a neuroscientist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. studied how pairs of rats sniffed each other when they were placed in the same enclosure. In initial observations. Wesson saw that when one rat started sniffing another’s body or behind. both rats ramped up their level of sniffing. But when one rat started sniffing the other’s face. the other rat typically backed off and turned down its level of sniffing.

Vernon Davis turned in one of the most impressive performances at the NFL scouting combine. He was a physical marvel. He was fast. He was strong. And he could jump. Based on this botched touchdown celebration. the 49ers tight end might not possess quite the same athleticism that he exhibited back then. especially when it comes to his vertical leap. After catching a 4-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith to put the 49ers up 22-7 in the third quarter. Davis went to “dunk” the ball over the crossbar at Lambeau. But the bar went all Mutumbo on Davis. rejecting him to the delight of the Packers fans. who hadn’t been given a ton to cheer about to that point.

sports,CAN THE YANKEES MAKE THE PLAYOFFS?,No one ever really thought the Yankees were going away. There were times when it looked dire -- the short-lived tenures of "starting" infielders Alberto Gonzalez and Luis Cruz. for instance. in the dark days just before the return of Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez -- but the Yankees haven't been truly out of a playoff race in September since 1992 (and have been out of the playoffs themselves only once since 1995). For most of the year. the Yankees have been patching the gaping holes in their line-up with whatever waiver wire or utility level Band-Aids they could get their hands on. in addition to Cruz and Gonzalez. Ben Francisco. Brennan Boesch. Brent Lillibridge. Chris Nelson and Reid Brignac all appeared in more than 10 games this season for New York. with former Cleveland Indian Mark Reynolds currently filling that role with 16 appearances for the Bronx Bombers so far -- one of which was his first major league start at second base. The majority of the catching duties this season have been handled by young. ineffective rookie Austin Romine and older. even more ineffective veteran Chris Stewart. comprising perhaps the least impressive catching duo in the league. Travis Ishikawa somehow snuck onto the roster one day and got a start in before someone corrected their mistake.

Studies in the last five years have focused largely on the athletic side of the equation - “taking them off the field. not putting them back on the field with symptoms. but this is really looking at the student side of the equation.” said senior author Gerard A. Gioia of Children’s National Health System in Rockville. Maryland. A toolkit called HEADS UP to Schools. from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. already advises school professionals that after a concussion. kids may need to spend fewer hours at school. take more time for tests or assignments. or may feel frustrated at being unable to keep up with schoolwork. Students should be seen by a health care professional. who can make decisions about school readiness based on symptoms.

The Gunners went into the game knowing that a win would see them open up a two-point lead over Liverpool at the top of the table and they did not waste their opportunity. producing a superb performance to claim the win. Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil put Arsenal in control before Jonny Howson pulled one back for the visitors. However. Arsene Wenger’s men were not to be denied as an Aaron Ramsey strike and a second from Ozil sealed victory. German playmaker Ozil was included in the starting XI for Arsenal after recovering from a knee problem suffered on international duty. while Norwich was without striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel because of a toe injury. After 18 minutes the deadlock was broken in magnificent fashion. as Wilshere tapped home to finish off a wonderful move involving Cazorla. Wilshere and Olivier Giroud. whose improvised flick-on from the edge of the area sent the England international through on goal. The hosts suffered a blow eight minutes before halftime as Mathieu Flamini was replaced by Ramsey following an earlier collision with Alexander Tettey. Arsenal’s grip on the game looked to be in danger in the closing stages of the first half. with Robert Snodgrass and Leroy Fer both drawing strong saves from Wojciech Szczesny. Norwich continued to press forward after the interval as Snodgrass and Martin Olsson tested Szczesny with long-range drives. But the visitors’ hopes of taking something from the game were severely dented when Ozil put Arsenal in control just before the hour mark. Giroud was again the creator. his perfectly-placed cross finding Ozil. who rounded off a superb counterattack with a fine header into the bottom corner.
sports,Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failed drugs test but will appeal,Maria Sharapova has been banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation for using a prohibited drug. The Russian was provisionally banned in March after testing positive for meldonium at January's Australian Open. The heart disease drug. which 29-year-old Sharapova says she has been taking since 2006 for health issues. became a banned substance on 1 January 2016. The five-time Grand Slam winner said she "cannot accept" the "unfairly harsh" ban - and will appeal. Sharapova will challenge the suspension. which is backdated to 26 January 2016. at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). In a statement. she said the tribunal concluded her offence was "unintentional" and that she had not tried to use a "performance-enhancing substance". But she claimed the ITF had asked the tribunal to impose a four-year ban. adding it "spent tremendous amounts of time and resources trying to prove I intentionally violated the anti-doping rules".
sports,Caroline Wozniacki Upset By Kaia Kanepi At French Open (VIDEO),It would be way too simple to say that this rollercoaster contest came down to Kaia Kanepi’s mental shortcomings versus Caroline Wozniacki’s physical limitations. Yes. Kanepi failed to serve it out four times — and wasted four match points — before ultimately prevailing. 6-1. 6-7 (3). 6-3. And yes. Wozniacki’s inability to hit through her stronger opponent contributed to the 5-1 deficits she faced in all three sets. But before this match is banished to the never-upload-to-YouTube pile. it must be said that it was Wozniacki’s assertive play. when Kanepi grew tentative in the second set. that propelled her unlikely rally. and it was the Estonian’s persistence that gave her a chance to capture the victory at all. Two years ago at Wimbledon. Kanepi let five match points go and never saw a sixth in a painful quarterfinal loss to Petra Kvitova. She was surely thinking of that when her fifth match point came today against Wozniacki. Something tells me she didn’t mind winning the match on a Wozniacki error.

Brazil. The group includes two Syrian swimmers. two judokas from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. and six runners from Ethiopia and South Sudan. The athletes have relocated to countries including Belgium. Germany. Luxembourg. Kenya ― and even Brazil. “Their participation in the Olympics is a tribute to the courage and perseverance of all refugees in overcoming adversity and building a better future for themselves and their families.” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. “UNHCR stands with them and with all refugees.” The IOC first announced the formation of a refugee-only team belonging to no one country in March. Here are the members of this year’s team: Yolande Mabika Fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo separated Mabika from her parents when she was a young child. She remembers little else but running alone and being picked up by a helicopter that took her to the capital. Kinshasa. she told UNHCR. There. living in a center for displaced children. she discovered judo. She went on to become a professional athlete. competing in major tournaments. “Judo never gave me money. but it gave me a strong heart.” she said. “I got separated from my family and used to cry a lot. I started with judo to have a better life.” In 2013. when she came to Rio to compete at the World Judo Championship. her coach confiscated her passport and limited her access to food. Fed up with years of abuse. including being caged after losing tournaments. Mabika fled the hotel and wandered the streets searching for help. Now. as a refugee in Brazil. she has won a spot on the Refugee Olympic Athlete team and received training from Flavio Canto. a Brazilian Olympic bronze medallist. “I will be part of this team and I will win a medal. I am a competitive athlete. and this is an opportunity that can change my life.” she said. “I hope my story will be an example for everybody. and perhaps my family will see me and we will reunite.” Yusra Mardini. 17 Mardini. who is from Damascus. swam all the way to the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey in order to find safety. She first boarded a flimsy vessel. but it started taking on water. Stranded off the Turkish coast with about 20 other desperate passengers. the teenager from Damascus slipped into the water with her sister. Sarah. and began pushing the boat towards Greece. “There were people who didn’t know how to swim.” she told UNHCR. “It would have been shameful if the people on our boat had drowned.” After arriving on Lesbos. she travelled north to Germany. where she eventually started training with a swim club in Berlin. in the fall of 2015. Now 18. she is preparing to compete in the womenï’s 200-meter freestyle event. “I want to represent all the refugees because I want to show everyone that. after the pain. after the storm. comes calm days.” she said. “I want to inspire them to do something good in their lives.” Rami Anis. 25 Anis is also a Syrian competitive swimmer. Hailing from Aleppo. he started formal swimming training when he was 14. according to UNHCR. He credits his Uncle Majad. who swam competitively in Syria. with sharing his passion for competing in the water. “Swimming is my life.” he said. “The swimming pool is my home.” As bombings and kidnappings in Aleppo grew more frequent. his family put him on a flight to Istanbul to live with an older brother who was studying Turkish. “The bag I took had two jackets. two T-shirts. two trousers.” he added. “I thought I would be in Turkey for a couple of months and then return to my country.”  As months turned to years. he used the time to hone his swimming technique at the Galatasaray Sports Club. Yet without Turkish nationality. he was unable to participate in competitions. Determined to find a way to compete. Anis rode an inflatable dinghy to the Greek island of Samos. Eventually he reached the Belgian town of Ghent. where he’s been training nine times a week with former Olympic swimmer Carine Verbauwen. Yonas Kinde. 36 “I normally train every day. but when I heard this news [about the refugee team] I trained two times per day. every day. targeting for these Olympic Games.” the Ethiopian runner told UNHCR. Kinde. who has lived in Luxembourg for five years now. rarely stops moving. He’s been taking French classes regularly and driving a taxi to earn a living. all while pushing himself to become a better runner. In Germany last October. he completed a marathon in only 2 hours and 17 minutes. But memories of fleeing his home remain uncomfortable territory. “It’s a difficult situation.” he says about life in Ethiopia. “It’s impossible for me to live there. it’s very dangerous for my life. I think it will be the big message that refugees. young athletes. they can do their best.” Anjelina Nadai Lohalith. 21 Lohalith. a refugee from South Sudan. will run the 1500-meter race at the 2016 games. She has not seen or spoken to her parents since she was 6 years old and was forced to flee her home. but she has heard that they are still alive. according to UNHCR. Helping her parents is her main motivation as she steps up her training. She knew she was good at athletics after winning school competitions at the refugee camp where she now lives in northern Kenya. But it was only when professional coaches came to select athletes for a special training camp that she realized just how fast she was. She now aims to compete internationally in order to win monetary prizes. “If you have money. then your life can change and you will not remain the way you have been.” she said. The first thing she would do with a big win? “Build my father a better house.” James Nyang Chiengjiek. 25 Chiengjiek is also a refugee from South Sudan living in Kenya. competing in the 800-meter race. He fled his home when he was 13 to avoid being kidnapped by rebels who were forcibly recruiting child soldiers. UNHCR said. As a refugee in neighboring Kenya. he attended school in a highland town known for its runners and joined a group of older boys training for long-distance events. At first he did not have proper running shoes. so we would sometimes borrow footwear from others. “We all of us got a lot of injuries because of the wrong shoes we had.” he said. “Then we were sharing. If maybe you have two pairs of shoes. then you help the one that has none.” When he goes to Rio. Chiengjiek aims to inspire others. “By running well. I am doing something good to help others. especially refugees.” he added. “Maybe among them are athletes with talent. but who did not yet get any opportunities. We have to look back and see where our brothers and sisters are. so if one of them also has talent. we can bring them to train with us and also make their lives better.” Rose Nathike Lokonyen. 23 Also from South Sudan. Lokonyen arrived in Kenya in 2002. She will compete in the 800-meter event. Lokonyen had never competed until about one year ago. when a teacher in her northern Kenya refugee camp suggested that she run a 10-kilometer race. she told UNHCR. “I had not been training. It was the first time for me to run. and I came [in] number two.” she said. She has since moved to a training camp near the Kenyan capital. Nairobi. Lokonyen sees athletics not only as a way to earn prize money and endorsements. but also as a way to inspire others. “I will be representing my people there at Rio. and maybe if I succeed I can come back and conduct a race that can promote peace. and bring people together.” she added. Yiech Pur Biel. 21 Forced to flee the fighting in southern Sudan in 2005. Biel ended up on his own in a refugee camp in northern Kenya. He started playing soccer there. but grew frustrated at having to rely so much on his teammates. With running he felt greater control over his own destiny. he explained to UNHCR. “In the refugee camp. we have no facilities. even shoes we don’t have. There is no gym.” he said. “Even the weather does not favor training because from morning up to the evening it is so hot and sunny.” Yet he stayed motivated. “I focused on my country. South Sudan. because we young people are the people who can change it.” he added. “And secondly. I focused on my parents. I need to change the life they are living.” Yiech hopes competing in the 800-meter race at Rio will help him become an ambassador for refugees everywhere. Popole Misenga Misenga was just 9 years old when he fled fighting in Kisingani. in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Separated from his family. he was rescued after eight days in the forest and taken to Kinshasa. according to UNHCR. Just like Mabika. he discovered judo in a center for displaced children. “When you are a child. you need to have a family to give you instructions about what to do. and I didn’t have one.” he said. “Judo helped me by giving me serenity. discipline. commitment.” He became a professional judoka. but each time he lost a competition his coach locked him in a cage for days with only coffee and bread to eat. Finally. at the 2013 world championships in Rio. where he was deprived of food and knocked out in the first round. he decided to seek asylum. “In my country. I didn’t have a home. a family or children. The war there caused too much death and confusion. and I thought I could stay in Brazil to improve my life.” he said. After gaining refugee status. he too began training with Canto. “I want to be part of the Refugee Olympic Athletes team to keep dreaming. to give hope to all refugees and take sadness out of them.” he said. Paulo Amotun Lokoro. 24 Only a few years ago. Lokoro was a young herder in South Sudan. He told UNHCR that he knew nothing of the world except his own homeland. which had been at war for almost all his life. He decided to flee to Kenya. where he’s had the freedom to develop his ambitions as a runner. “I want to be world champion.” he said. Living in a refugee camp. he excelled in school sports. ultimately gaining a spot on the refugee squad now training near Nairobi under the guidance of Tegla Loroupe. the renowned Kenyan runner who holds several world records. “Before I came here I did not even have training shoes.” he added. “Now we know fully how to be athletes.” He is happy to be racing the 1500 meter on behalf of refugees. “I was one of those refugees there in the camp. and now I have reached somewhere special. I will meet so many people. My people will see me on the television. on Facebook.” he said. Still. his aim is simple: “If I perform well. I will use that to help support my family. and my people.”
sports,Jaguars’ Defensive Back Earl Wolff Was Allegedly Kidnapped By Gunmen,Earl Wolff. a practice squad defensive back for the Jacksonville Jaguars. was allegedly kidnapped last month by gunmen in North Carolina before being released unharmed. according to an online police report. The 26-year-old. who previously played for the Philadelphia Eagles and North Carolina State. was visiting friends in Fayetteville on Feb. 23 when he was taken at gunpoint and forced into his 2011 Range Rover around 3 a.m. “We don’t know how long he was kidnapped.” Fayetteville police spokesman Antoine Kincade told the Fayetteville Observer. which was the first to break the news Saturday. “But it was a short period of time.” Wolff tweeted his gratitude to his supporters on Sunday. Jaguars spokesman Tad Dickman tweeted Saturday that Wolff was doing well and asked that the media respect his privacy. On Thursday police arrested a suspect in the attack. identified as Bobby Deshawn Bailey. The 21-year-old faces charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon. first-degree kidnapping. conspiracy. larceny. possession of a stolen motor vehicle and possession of marijuana. It’s not yet clear whether Wolff’s kidnapping was targeted or random. Wolff played 11 games for the Eagles in 2013 and seven in 2014. He was waived in August and after agreeing to an injury settlement went on to sign to the Jaguars’ practice squad in December. according to ESPN.
sports,The Dallas Cowboys Are Going All-In On Abusive Greg Hardy,There’s no turning back. Within the Dallas Cowboys organization. the reaction to Greg Hardy’s Sunday night sideline fight with special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia has been an unequivocal endorsement of Hardy’s actions. even as fans and media alike rightly question whether the team’s blind support of a convicted domestic abuser makes them an enabler. The Cowboys haven’t wavered in their isolated support for Hardy and his attempt to square up and fight his coach. Following the game. Bisaccia. head coach Jason Garrett and wide receiver Dez Bryant all said Hardy’s outburst was “no issue.” with Garrett explaining on Monday that Hardy wouldn’t face any discipline — a stern talking to from the head coach was deemed enough for this angry. violent man. although the meeting might’ve been conducted with their heads in the sand. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones went a step further on Sunday night. tagging Hardy a player who’s earned the distinction as “one of the real leaders on this team.” a notion that the Cowboys have been trying to implant since June. Impossibly. Jones wants us to believe that Hardy — who’s played all of two games for the Cowboys following his unremorseful return from a domestic violence suspension. who reportedly went MIA last Thursday before practice and who lost his s**t on his teammates without getting much of a reaction from them — is presumably up there with veterans Tony Romo and Jason Witten as a “real leader.” New video of the sideline scuffle shows Hardy’s teammates responding to him with confused. indifferent looks. but according to Jones. that’s leadership material right there. The only defense of Hardy’s Sunday sideline incident has come from ESPN’s Skip Bayless of all people. which is perhaps the strongest indicator of how wrong the Cowboys are on the issue of their defensive end. And yet. the Cowboys plan to reward — not discipline — Hardy after all. During a Monday radio interview on 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM]. Cowboys Executive Vice President Stephen Jones said that the team was “absolutely” looking to re-sign Hardy to a long-term contract next offseason — a decision likely made in excitement over Hardy’s three sacks in two games and overall strong pass-rushing play. which is what he was controversially signed to do in the first place. In simple football terms. the Cowboys are pumped to have another DeMarcus Ware-level sack artist and are willing to fold their entire sense of right and wrong into a probable multi-year eight-figure contract for Hardy. The decision to sign Hardy in March 2015 was supposed to be made with respect to his history of violence against women. Hardy was supposed to be a different person by now. He isn’t. The Cowboys are supposed to care about that. They don’t. And that’s worrying the NFL. Following Hardy’s willful ignorance and failure to address his own domestic abuse case. Lisa Friel. the NFL’s special counsel for investigations. told The Huffington Post in early October that his non-responses were “troubling.” “I hope for his sake and everyone’s sake that his behavior is better than his language.” Friel said at the time. Instead. Hardy’s behavior is once again causing trouble. In the midst of the NFL season. it’s clear that the 2-4 Cowboys will do and say anything to downplay Hardy’s behavior even as it becomes increasingly unacceptable — not that it wasn’t already. He’s apparently too invaluable to their defense to cut. but this is an abusive man whose anger can and will lead to harmful situations. and so far. the optics of Hardy’s NFL life haven’t indicated much of a change. But screw it. let’s let Garrett be the guy who manages his behavior! The Cowboys are seemingly splitting Hardy into two different people. There’s Hardy. star football player and Hardy. the hot-tempered misogynist who’s choked out a woman before. The former is all the Cowboys see. The latter is who he really is and how “people outside the building.” as Garrett put it. see him. It’s who he is to fans who don’t care about the Cowboys’ win-loss record and who he is to the greater public when violent sideline outbursts happen on national television. In reality. he’s one in the same. But when football matters more than a person’s destructive personality. plaudits and riches await instead of help. Fresh air is dearly needed inside of the Cowboys’ stadium — not another excuse. Open the window and smell your s**t. Jerry. 
sports,Darren Sharper May Have Penis Monitored As Part Of Probation. Report Says,Ex-NFL safety Darren Sharper may have his penis monitored as part of his probation after he serves at least nine years for drugging and raping several women. according to a report. The New Orleans Advocate reported that the former New Orleans Saints player will face several restrictions upon his release: GPS tracking; sex offender counseling for many years; no alcohol and no visits to bars for the rest of his life; no Internet dating; and approval to travel more than 50 miles. One condition of his post-prison life that is attracting a lot of attention is the possibility that his Arizona probation could subject Sharper to a “penile plethysmograph. in which a sensor is attached to the penis while an array of sexual images flashes before his eyes. to gauge arousal.” the Advocate wrote. According to the New York Daily News. some experts believe that sex offenders’ responses could determine the likelihood of them committing similar crimes again. The device resembles a blood pressure cuff. measuring blood flow to the penis while users watch material that might represent their criminal proclivities. As part of an intricate plea deal. Reuters reported. Sharper pleaded guilty to sexual assault and attempted sexual assault in Arizona; guilty to attempted sexual assault in Nevada; and no contest to two counts of rape by use of drugs and four counts of furnishing a controlled substance in California. A case in New Orleans is pending.
sports,Chick Hearn Predicted How Long Kobe Would Play For The Lakers,Known for coining basketball slang like “slam dunk” and “triple-double.” longtime Lakers commentator Chick Hearn proved prescient this week. more than a decade after he passed away. On Monday. a video was posted showing the all-time great play-by-play man talking with fellow hoops G.O.A.T. Kobe Bryant. early in the latter’s professional career. Hearn eerily predicts that Bryant has “got 19 or 20 years to play with the Lakers.” That 20-year guess hit the nail on the head. with — as we all know by now — No. 24 announcing on Sunday that he will retire this spring. right after his 20th campaign with Los Angeles. Lakers fans will surely begin to feel nostalgia slink over them as Bryant’s farewell tour continues in the coming months — and with a bevy of video tributes and framed jerseys coming Kobe’s way. all we’ll be missing is Chick Hearn’s famous voice. telling us what is happening. play by play.
sports,Don’t Believe The Derrick Rose Hype,No sooner had Derrick Rose declared he was back. than he was sidelined with hamstring tendinitis. The 27-year-old Chicago Bulls point guard was playing his best basketball all season. averaging over 19 points in the 2016 calendar year. Rose’s steadiness and renewed sense of confidence stems from no longer having to wear a protective face mask. Amid tremendous dysfunction with a first-year head coach in Fred Hoiberg. along with a front office that was expecting a winner this year and instead got a clunky mix of disappointments. Rose’s play has been a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately though. the former league MVP has cemented his legacy as an extremely talented. oft injured player of unfulfilled promise. Bulls fans know all too well that when things with Rose seem too good to be true. it’s because they usually are. This recent stretch of production should be viewed as no different. After playing 81 games during the 2010-11 campaign. he combined to play in a mere 100 matches over three seasons. And. in that span. Rose was supplanted by fellow backcourt mate Jimmy Butler — who caught up with The Huffington Post in 2013 on the verge of his breakout success — as the clear-cut face of the franchise. Interestingly enough. the former No. 1 overall pick is far more productive with Butler (a two-time All-Star) on the bench and vise-versa. According to ESPN. Butler’s scoring increases from 19.4 points per 36 minutes to 24.5 when Rose is out. Moreover. when Butler is out. Rose improves his scoring from 16.8 points to 23.4. per 36. Despite the immense combined talent of both guards. they cannot co-exist at an elite clip together.Rose has proven to be too ball dominant. Furthermore. with Butler recently sidelined with a knee injury. Rose has played some of his best ball yet. Rose’s recent surge is not sustainable because he still struggles to shoot the ball proficiently. nor does he get to the rim frequently enough to augment such long-range deficiencies. He has never shot fewer free-throws in his career (3). and his sub-27 percent shooting from 3 is the worst of any starting point guard in the NBA. But even if we can overlook those issues. Rose’s key problem — even with his improved play — is a lack of overall efficiency. Of the 25 players with a usage rate (the number of possessions a player uses per 40 minutes) of 26 or more. Rose’s 13.54 player efficiency rating is the lowest clip. Kobe Bryant offered insight last week into how Chicago’s prodigal son can maximize his ability without the top notch athleticism and speed he once possessed. “Derrick is at a position in his career where he’ll have to adjust his game.” Bryant told ESPN. “And what I mean by that is start using his size a lot more instead of his speed and quickness and start going to the post a little bit more.” While Rose is certainly not at fault for his slew of injuries and diminished athletic ability. adjusting his style to highlight what plus attributes he still has is a necessity. Whether or not he has done so depends on who you ask. And Rose hasn’t been shy to voice his opinion either: “I think I’m a little bit more efficient.” he said. “I feel like I’m getting to spots. my spots that I want to get to on the floor. instead of settling.” Perhaps we can attribute his improved production to such a philosophy or maybe new-found confidence. And perhaps it will continue. Then again. when it comes to Derrick Rose. the injury questions always persist. and so too does the reality that he is completely removed from the NBA elite.
sports,Olympic Silver Medalist Gus Kenworthy Comes Out As Gay,Professional freeskier Gus Kenworthy has come out as gay. The Olympic medalist made the announcement Thursday morning on Twitter. telling followers of his sexual orientation in a straight-to-the-point message which read simply. “I am gay.” The tweet accompanied a photo of the athlete on the cover of the latest ESPN Magazine. which is publishing a profile on Kenworthy and the struggle he’s faced in coming out. That struggle has been especially difficult as a freeskier. Kenworthy told ESPN. a sport he acknowledges glorifies the “alpha male thing” at times. Kenworthy said that in his darkest moments. he even considered taking his own life. “Hiding everything away is so painful.” he said in a video on ESPN. “You’re constantly lying and constantly feeling like you’re being deceitful. I’m just at that point where I’m ready to open up and let everyone see me for me and I hope everyone accepts it.” Kenworthy earned a silver medal at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. and then stayed in Russia for an extra month to rescue stray dogs and bring them home to Denver. Plenty of athletes voiced their support for Kenworthy following his announcement. including the U.S. Freeskiing team. which tweeted that it was “A huge day in action sports. the @Olympics and in @guskenworthy​’s life. We stand with him and support him.” Others chimed in:
sports,Dear Pro Athletes. Stop Playing With Fireworks,The allure of fireworks is pretty self-explanatory. Explosions. Cool colors. They go boom. and they go bang. We ooh and we aah. and sometimes we sing a national anthem that’s basically an ode to fireworks. But despite all that. we need to say something. and we need everyone to listen. especially all you professional athletes out there: Stop fucking with fireworks. It’s a simple lesson that would have served New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback C.J. Wilson well. Both are coming to terms with horrifying accidents and subsequent amputations performed this week to treat hand injuries caused by firework accidents on the night of 4th of July. On average. 200 Americans go to the emergency room every day between June 17 and July 17 because of firework-related injurites. according to the Consumer Products Safety Commision. Forty-six percent of those injuries are inflicted on hands and fingers. two important parts of the body for professional athletes. Yes. NFL players — especially ones whose careers depend on catching and throwing footballs — need hands to play. Even the positions that don’t get to touch the football much. like offensive and defensive line. need their hands to grab. yank and tackle. Like. look at this photo. Is this what you want. football players? Thankfully this guy. Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews. didn’t sustain that hand injury playing with fireworks. It was just a routine broken bone. But let it serve as a reminder that you. dear professional athlete. could have a CLUB FOR A HAND if you mess around with fireworks. “Yes. [taking the cast off] will leave my fingers free. which means more sacks and more tackles.” Matthews said when the club was finally removed. See? On Wednesday. Wilson’s agent confirmed the hand injury to ESPN. While he declined to elaborate on the specifics of the injury. the Tampa Bay Times reported that Wilson. who appeared in two games last season. lost two fingers on one hand in a 4th of July fireworks accident. Down two fingers. Wilson’s playing career is in serious jeopardy. according to the NFL Network. Pierre-Paul’s future career prospects are rosier — he’s an All-Pro defensive end and he’s got one more finger than Wilson. But his right index finger was amputated. as ESPN reported. and although he’s expected to play in 2015. the accident has already proven to be costly. The Giants withdrew their $60 million long-term contract offer to Pierre-Paul in the wake of the incident. citing concerns about his health and overall judgement. Pierre-Paul is still due to make $14.5 million this upcoming season. so all things considered. he’ll be okay. Plus: Robot fingers are coming. If anything. Pierre-Paul can use his guaranteed millions to technically become a cyborg. Wilson. on the other hand. might be screwed. An undrafted former member of the Bucs’ practice squad. he was expected to compete for a backup cornerback position in training camp. His $585.000 base salary for 2015 is non-guaranteed. so he can be cut at any time at no cost to the team. Fireworks are not worth losing a half-million dollar paycheck and an NFL career. Athletes. take care of your damn hands. You need those things. They’re what separate modern man from the fish we evolved from. And your hands. in particular. with all of their strength and dexterity. are what separates you from the plebs who don’t have a career in professional athletics. Love fireworks too much to eradicate them from your life completely? Here’a novel idea: HAVE SOMEONE ELSE LIGHT THE FIREWORKS. You have entourages willing to do anything to protect your health (and therefore your playing career and paycheck). Millions of people around the world enjoy the simple pleasures of fireworks without being the sucker who actually puts their fingers near a lit fuse. Next 4th of July. when you’re facing a literal truckload of fireworks. just remember: Stop the madness. Put the fireworks down. 
sports,Novak Djokovic Loses To Sam Querrey In Upset At Wimbledon,Novak Djokovic is fallible after all. as American powerhouse Sam Querrey proved in stunning fashion to stop the Serb’s seemingly unstoppable charge toward a calendar year grand slam at a rain-hit Wimbledon on Saturday. The 28th seed boomed down 31 aces and repelled an attempted Djokovic comeback to win a third-round match that began the previous evening 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 7-6(5). Top seed and defending champion Djokovic had trailed by two sets overnight after the Court One clash was stopped by rain on Friday but such is the 29-year-old’s aura that most expected him to turn it around. just as he did when faced with a similar predicament against Kevin Anderson last year. On the resumption. the Serb won the opening four games before another rain delay. but wobbled slightly before securing the third set to halve the deficit. Djokovic appeared distracted at times. looking up to Boris Becker in his coaching box. but was primed to level the match when he served at 5-4 in the fourth. only for Querrey to break. When yet another rain delay sent the players off court for an hour with Djokovic serving at 5-6. he returned to take it into a tiebreak. Querrey went 6-4 ahead and though Djokovic saved one match point with an ace. he shanked a forehand into the tramlines to end his 30-match winning streak in grand slam play — a run that meant he arrived at Wimbledon holding all four major titles. Defeat scuppered his hopes of becoming the first man to win all four majors in a year since Rod Laver in 1969 and was his first loss before the quarter-final of a major since the 2009 French Open when he also bowed out in the third round. OVERPOWERED ME “Congratulations to Sam. He played a terrific match.” Djokovic said shortly after walking on court. “He serves very well. I think that part of his game was brutal today. “He just overpowered me.” Querrey was the first American to beat Djokovic in a grand slam since Andy Roddick in 2009 and he will take on Nicolas Mahut of France with a place in a first grand slam quarter-final beckoning. “It’s incredible. especially to do it at Wimbledon. the biggest tournament in the world.” said the world number 41 who had lost eight of nine matches against Djokovic. “I am so ecstatic right now. so happy and that’s about it. “I think that today I played the break points really well. Every time he had a break point I was able to come up with a big serve. And in the end I just fought the tiebreak and got a couple of loose errors and that was it.” After initial nerves on Saturday. Querrey showed great composure. saving 11 out of 12 break points in the fourth set. several with aces. as Djokovic tried everything to take the match into a deciding set. It looked as though the pressure had told when he dropped serve in the ninth game. but he re-grouped immediately and brought up two break points with a stunning backhand pass. Djokovic saved the first but scooped a low volley into the net to huge cheers from the crowd. Querrey held serve before rain returned with Djokovic serving to stay alive. But it could not douse Querrey’s fighting spirit as he battled back from 3-1 down in the tiebreak to complete his first victory over a current world number one. “I had my chances.” said Djokovic who confirmed he would not play in the Davis Cup quarter-final against Britain this month. “I just wasn’t feeling the ball as well as I wished.”

sports,Ray Rice’s Pyrrhic Victory,Arbitrator Barbara Smith has set aside the indefinite disciplinary suspension NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell imposed on Baltimore Ravens’ running back Ray Rice after an unprecedented proceeding under the collective bargaining agreement between the League and the Players Association. The opinion clearly evidences former federal judge Smith’s experienced hand at writing judicial opinions. Her ultimate determination — that the Commissioner’s decision increasing Rice’s suspension from two games to potentially a lifetime ban was “arbitrary” — was well founded. The Ray Rice incident has come to a close at least as far as the parties’ dispute resolution procedure is concerned. Rice’s conduct. which gave rise to his discipline in the first instance. has now received the universal condemnation it deserved. Arbitrator Smith briefly mentions in her opinion the NFL’s previous failure to adequately censure cases of domestic violence. There can be little doubt that the NFL has learned its lesson. In her opinion. Arbitrator Smith focused on the central factual controversy: what did Ray Rice tell the Commissioner during his meeting with Goodell on June 16th? A labor arbitrator is often asked to determine the “facts.” Of course. he or she is at a comparative disadvantage.  The arbitrator generally is the only person at the arbitration hearing who was not present at the event in question.  Stories presented in arbitration from the various witnesses who were there often differ. sometimes quite substantially. An arbitrator “finds facts” by examining the conflicting recollections and whatever documents might be available. Here. the Arbitrator had the advantage of using the written notes taken by some of the participants at that meeting. She concluded that Rice had told the Commissioner that he “hit” his fiancée in the elevator that night. Although the Commissioner’s version differed. Arbitrator Smith wisely did not suggest that Goodell was lying. In fact. he likely was not lying. but rather remembered a different version of the event. Arbitrators need not accuse one witness or another of fabricating testimony. Such an accusation would likely exacerbate the parties’ continuing relationship.  It is preferable for the arbitrator simply to state the facts as she finds them. The Commissioner’s more significant error in the Ray Rice investigation was in failing to obtain the tape of what had occurred inside the elevator. The Arbitrator does state that the NFL knew that the recording existed. Seeing the tape of Rice’s left hook landing on his fiancée’s face would have rightly infuriated the Commissioner and led to more serious discipline right from the start. The media has explained Arbitrator Smith’s decision as based on concepts of “double jeopardy.” although she does not use that precise term. She does rely on the Commissioner’s own pledge to insure that “fairness” prevailed in this matter. Essential to the concept of fairness in the workplace is management’s obligation to thoroughly investigate an incident before imposing discipline.  An employer who rushes to punish an employee and then discovers further evidence that would warrant increasing the penalty would likely have its more serious discipline overturned in arbitration. The arbitrator acts to preserve the employee’s right to fair treatment. including a thorough investigation. That does not mean an employee must be kept at work - or. in this case. on the football field — while the investigation proceeds. Management can suspend an employee pending completion of the investigation. The hearing before Arbitrator Smith and her resulting arbitration decision demonstrates how due process can operate in the workplace.  It would seem incumbent upon the Players Association during the next set of negotiations with the League to establish a contractual procedure for arbitral review in these types of cases — a process that is not currently available under the collective bargaining agreement and was only used because the Commissioner would otherwise have had to testify in a proceeding where he was the sole adjudicator. The parties have used the services of an arbitrator in other types of cases and have recently agreed to such impartial review under their new “Policy and Program on Substances of Abuse.” Ray Rice’s victory in arbitration. however. is unlikely to return him to the Ravens’ backfield or even to the roster of any of the other 31 clubs in the NFL. The hearing focused on how badly he had behaved that night in Atlantic City. and he prevailed only because the Arbitrator believed that he had told the Commissioner about his censurable misconduct. Returning Rice to the football field would provide exactly the type of distraction NFL clubs abhor. Nothing good for “number 27” will come out of this proceeding. On the other hand. for those men and women who are victims of domestic violence. the public attention focused by the Rice proceeding might make more people aware of this societal scourge.
sports,Rory McIlroy's Dad Wins 10-Year-Old Bet After Son's British Open Win: Report,It was a big day for the McIlroy family. According to Andrew Cotter of BBC. Rory McIlroy’s father. Gerry. placed a bet in 2004 that his son would win the British Open before he turned 26 years old. A spokesperson for British betting firm Ladbrokes told Rachel Bridge of ESPN.com on Sunday that two other bets were made in 2005 by people believed to be Gerry’s friends. According to Bridge. Gerry wagered 200 pounds at 500/1 odds while his friends bet 200 pounds at 250/1 odds for Rory to win the British Open by 2015 and another 200 pounds at 150/1 odds for McIlroy to win the tournament before age 50. Their confidence in Rory paid off. McIlroy. 25. went on to win the British Open on Sunday without ever surrendering the lead or tying throughout the four rounds. Bridge reported after McIlroy’s victory that Gerry will win $171.000 for his bet and his friends will win a total of $136.700 for the other two.  As for the star golfer out of Northern Ireland. the prize money for the British Open championship is $1.665.933. It doesn’t get much sweeter than that. 
sports,Ray Lewis On Domestic Abuse In NFL: ‘Some Things You Can Cover Up.. Some Things You Can’t’,If Ray Lewis could go back and choose a different set of words. he probably would. Speaking Sunday on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown.” the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker offered his perspective on domestic violence in the NFL. focusing in particular on his former teammate Ray Rice. who was suspended from the team earlier this month after a video surfaced of Rice knocking out his now-wife in an elevator in February. After offering a passionate defense of the Ravens organization and the NFL’s handling of the case (“If they could do this all over again. they would.” he said). Lewis turned his attention to the video of Rice punching his then-fiancee in the face and said. “There’s some things you can cover up. and there’s some things you can’t.” It was a terrible choice of words for anyone addressing the issue of domestic violence. Many victims of domestic abuse literally “cover up” the marks left by their aggressors with makeup. a tactic Refuge.org. a domestic violence nonprofit in the United Kingdom. says is adopted by 65 percent of abused women. The phrasing was worse still for Lewis in particular. whose own career would have been derailed in 2000. critics say. but for a covered-up double homicide investigation. Lewis ultimately pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice — a misdemeanor. per USA Today — for his involvement in the as-yet unsolved murders.

sports,Hall of Fame will allow Junior Seau’s daughter to speak at induction,The daughter of the late Junior Seau will be able to speak live during the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony after all. FOX Sports has learned the Hall has added some opportunities that will help Sydney Seau further honor her father as a posthumous selection next Saturday in Canton. Ohio. Sydney will be given the chance to participate in an on-stage interview conducted after the unveiling of Seau’s bust. The Hall also has invited Sydney and Seau’s three sons to unveil his bust on stage. Normally. the unveiling is only done by the presenter and enshrinee. The Hall will continue to uphold its rule calling for only a video presentation of a posthumous inductee that includes the presenter’s speech. However. the Hall has taped a 6 1/2-minute highlight video of Seau’s 20-year NFL career that includes comments from Sydney. The normal highlight video lasts three minutes. Sydney also will be participating in the Thursday night "Gold Jacket" ceremony that marks the first major Hall event of the week. She will be given the chance to make remarks during the NFL Network telecast. The Hall’s moves were made following a controversy involving the induction speaker rules and the perception that Sydney Seau was being silenced to keep from speaking about the circumstances surrounding her father’s death. Seau committed suicide in 2012 at age 43. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the NFL the following year claiming that brain damage suffered while playing football led to him committing suicide. The lawsuit is still being litigated. There also was some confusion from the Seau family about whether Sydney was initially told by the Hall that she could deliver the induction speech for her father during the ceremony. "Our goal was to try and keep our policy but also show some compassion and understanding." Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker told FOX Sports. "Through all the conversations. Sydney has always been great. "She will have the opportunity to say whatever she wants to say but we will still maintain our (posthumous induction) policy. We want this to be a great day for Sydney and her family. Should she choose not to speak afterward. that should be OK." NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was among those who were hoping the Hall reconsider the formatting of Seau’s induction ceremony. A source told FOX Sports that Goodell called Baker on Friday to ask whether there was anything that could be done by the Hall. which is an independent entity. to give Sydney Seau a further chance to speak. Baker told Goodell about the Hall’s plans to expand Sydney’s involvement. The Hall then finalized those changes on Saturday morning. the source said. Seau was a first-team All-Pro selection eight times and also voted to 12 Pro Bowls as both an inside and outside linebacker. A 1990 first-round pick by the San Diego Chargers. Seau became one of the most popular players in franchise history before being traded to Miami during the 2003 offseason. Seau announced his retirement after three seasons with the Dolphins before quickly changing his mind and accepting a contract offer from New England where he played from 2006 to 2009. Seau was voted into the Hall of Fame last February in his first year of eligibility.
sports,Refs Calling Questionable Fouls At The End Of NCAA Tournament Games Is The Worst (VIDEO),Nobody filled out an NCAA Tournament bracket that had Tony Greene advancing to the Final Four but that didn’t keep him from being involved in a pivotal moment in the Elite Eight. Greene. a referee. called a controversial offensive foul in the final seconds of a thrilling overtime clash between No. 1 Arizona and No. 2 Wisconsin in the West regional final. With Wisconsin clinging to a 64-63 lead in the final seconds of the overtime session. Greene whistled Arizona guard Nick Johnson for a foul as he drove for a potential go-ahead basket. Johnson. Arizona’s leading scorer. drove toward the rim and made contact with Wisconsin’s Josh Gasser with three seconds remaining. Greene determined that Johnson’s push off warranted a whistle. The call seemed to change the moods of those following the exciting Elite Eight action on Twitter from #WOW to #WTF. Arizona would actually regain possession before the final buzzer but would not get off another shot as Wisconsin held on for the win.  “I thought it was a really. really tough call.” Arizona coach Sean Miller told reporters after the game when asked about the call. “I’m going to stop there. I’ve already been fined.” Based on his reaction on Twitter. Michigan forward Jordan Morgan seemed to find the call far more amusing than Miller. Tennessee’s Jordan McCrae seemed less amused than Morgan. A night earlier. Michigan and Tennessee were involved in another game that included a controversial offensive foul in a key moment. With No. 2 Michigan holding on to a 72-71 lead. No. 11 Tennessee had the ball and 10 seconds to find a potential game-winning basket. Following a timeout. the ball went to Tennessee’s Jarnell Stokes. The 6’ 8” Volunteers forward drove toward the basket and was bracketed by a pair of Michigan defenders. Michigan’s Caris Levert reached in to poke the ball way. Morgan. who had planted himself in Stokes’ path. fell to the court. With Morgan on the floor. Stokes was whistled for an offensive foul. Tennessee had nearly erased a 15-point deficit before that call on Stokes halted the comeback bid. Nik Stauskas would subsequently add a free throw to close out Michigan’s 73-71 win. “No. I don’t think I fouled him.” Stokes said when asked about the play during his postgame press conference. “But it was a smart play for him to try to take the charge. He pretty much anticipated it.” While a foul remains a foul regardless of the time showing on the clock. this crucial call also drew widespread criticism for being a dubious infraction at a key moment. Whether it was questionable foul calls or lengthy reviews of out of bounds plays. two games that had previously embodied the best of March Madness seemed to end with the officials being discussed nearly as much as the players.

sports,4 More Reasons Wisconsin Should Make the College Football Playoff,A couple days ago. I posted an argument for the Wisconsin Badgers making the inaugural College Football Playoff if they beat Ohio State on Saturday. The article drew a wide readership and many strong responses. a majority of which were along the lines of. “Wisconsin has no place in the playoff discussion.” The College Football Playoff committee putting seven-wins-in-a-row Wisconsin at #13 this week. behind two teams from Mississippi whose combined record over their last 10 games is 5-5 — with one of those wins coming against an FCS team — seemed to confirm what many thought: Wisconsin has no shot at the College Football Playoff. win or lose Saturday. But wait. The final word on college sports. ESPN. has now chimed in to say that it believes Wisconsin is very much alive for the playoffs if it wins on Saturday and Florida State loses to Georgia Tech — a scenario that’s not at all unlikely. As ESPN correspondent Heather Dinich wrote in a feature article on the playoffs on Thursday (December 4th). “If Florida State and Ohio State both lose. the committee would then have to choose among a one-loss Florida State. a second Big 12 team. and Big Ten champion Wisconsin or Mississippi State.” So you’re saying there’s a chance. In fact. ESPN doubled down on this prediction in its GameDay Kickoff Show live chat. in which Dinich said that if Florida State drops out of the top four spots after this weekend. the beneficiary would be “Ohio State or Wisconsin.” Because the top experts in the field are now saying Wisconsin’s still part of this discussion. and because the question of whether Wisconsin should or should not be discussed as a serious contender to make the playoffs drew a lot of attention and energy this week. I’ve supplemented my six arguments in favor of the Badgers making the CFP with four more. Ten reasons in total seems like a good number.  Given that the CFP committee has pretty clearly signaled that Florida State won’t hold on to their #4 ranking if they lose this weekend (after all. they dropped a spot last week even after beating Florida). and because it’s inconceivable that a Mississippi State team that’s lost two of its last three games would be in the playoffs ahead of a Wisconsin squad that — with a win over Ohio State — would have won eight straight games (including seven wins against FBS bowl teams). this article and its predecessor now seem more timely than ever. 1. No One Believes Two Losses Is a Disqualifier for the Playoffs. Throughout the college football world this week. we heard that if Alabama got its second loss this weekend against Georgia Tech. it could still make the CFP. We heard the same thing about an Arizona win over Oregon: that it could be enough to put a two-loss Wildcats squad into the playoffs. Kansas State fans took to social media en masse to note that if they beat Baylor and Florida State loses. they should get the #4 spot behind #3 TCU in January. even with two losses. Vegas oddsmakers announced on Monday that Missouri (9-2) had the seventh-best chance of making the playoffs — 28-1 odds. certainly long ones but not nothing. either — if they win on Saturday. Yet somehow there has been a sense that Wisconsin (10-2) — despite becoming officially the hottest team in the FBS if Florida State loses and the Badgers beat the Buckeyes — was fooling itself to even consider a Big Ten championship and an 11-2 record worthy of playoff consideration. Josh Moyer on ESPN said it would require “unprecedented craziness” on Saturday. and other pundits agreed. But let’s be clear: the chances of someone making the playoff this year with two losses are not particularly long. whether that someone is Arizona. Kansas State. Georgia Tech. Missouri. Mississippi State or. yes. Wisconsin. Heck. the committee even put a three-loss Ole Miss team within hailing distance of the top four. So let’s not pretend a team having two losses is a basis for dismissing them from consideration for the playoffs. 2. The Argument Against Wisconsin Ignores the Reality of “Good Losses” and “Bad Wins.” I wrote in my previous article that Wisconsin didn’t lose to then-#13 LSU on the field in August — which is true. given the in-game freak injuries to two-thirds of its defensive line. the loss of its starting quarterback. and a miscommunication that led to Melvin Gordon inadvertently sitting out the second half — but even if you treat the LSU loss as an on-field defeat. it’s a “good” loss. The definition of a “good” loss is basically any loss that actually strengthens your argument for being a top college football team. Wisconsin. on the road. against a higher-ranked opponent. without its starting quarterback. without its starting running back. without two-thirds of its defensive line. was beating LSU 24-7 at halftime and 24-13 going into the fourth quarter. Whatever you think of what happened in the fourth quarter. remember that this was a game which — according to the rankings of the two teams and the fact that it was being playing down South — Wisconsin was supposed to lose. Nothing in that loss suggested that Wisconsin had been erroneously ranked or otherwise misjudged by the AP voters who put them at #15. In fact. the result only confirmed their — and the nation’s — judgment of this Badger squad as Top 15 material in August. They’re much more than that now. There’s no way around it: whatever happens on Saturday. one of Baylor’s two most recent games will be a game in which it gave up 46 points to a 4-8 team. That’s the very definition of a “bad win.” While Mississippi State — like every SEC team — more or less gets credit for a “good loss” whenever they lose to anybody in-conference (whereas Wisconsin beating Top 20 Nebraska and Minnesota teams over the past three weeks seemed to mean nothing at all). even the “good loss” theory doesn’t excuse Mississippi State losing two of its last three. and Ole Miss losing three of its last seven. Not when Wisconsin hasn’t lost in months and by Saturday night it might be boasting three wins against Top 20 teams in its last four contests — including one win. this Saturday in Indianapolis. against a Top 5 team. 3. If It Comes Down to Wisconsin and Baylor. Wisconsin Should Be In. Let’s assume for a moment that the CFP committee won’t put Mississippi State. a non-conference champion. two-loss team that (a) lost its last game. and (b) has lost two of its last three. into the playoffs. And let’s imagine. as this article imagines — and not unreasonably — that Florida State loses to Georgia Tech on Saturday. If that happens. it’s entirely possible that this whole discussion comes down to Baylor and Wisconsin. as the Oregon-Arizona winner (and Pac-12 champion) is likely in. as are Alabama and TCU with (heavily predicted) wins this weekend. If it comes down to a one-loss Baylor team and a two-loss Wisconsin team. a lot of people will be surprised to learn that it’s an incredibly close call on the merits. but in the end Wisconsin is the better option for the CFP committee. There are the obvious reasons for this. at least one of which have to do with the fact that if it comes down to Wisconsin and Baylor. TCU is likely already into the playoff due to a win over a horrid Iowa State team this weekend. So here are some numbers the committee would be looking at in that scenario: (a) Wisconsin would be B1G champs. whereas Baylor would merely be an unofficial conference co-champion from a conference already well-represented in the playoffs. (b) Wisconsin’s 26-24 road loss to a Top 15 SEC opponent (LSU) in August is a better result than Baylor’s pathetic 48-46 win over a terrible (4-8) Texas Tech team last week. If “good wins” and “bad losses” matter. Baylor having one loss and the Badgers two is a misstatement of where the two teams stand on that score. (c) Wisconsin would be 11-2. and Baylor 10-1. meaning that while Wisconsin would have an extra loss. it would also have an extra win. (d) Wisconsin. with a win Saturday. would have won eight in a row. with seven wins against FBS bowl teams. no narrow victories over bad teams. and three blowouts (more-than-three-score victories) against FBS bowl teams. By contrast. Baylor is 7-1 in its last eight games. with a narrow win over a bad Texas Tech team just last week and only one blowout of an FBS bowl team during that span. And the committee has made clear that recent performance matters a great deal in its deliberations. (e) Wisconsin has defeated (assuming a win against Ohio State) eight FBS bowl teams in total. while Baylor (even with a win Saturday) would only have defeated half that number: four. (f) Wisconsin went 3-1 in non-conference play. playing teams with a combined record of 24-24 and beating one FBS bowl team handily; Baylor went 3-0 in non-conference play. but played teams with a combined record of 11-23 and beat no FBS bowl teams. (g) Wisconsin is a slightly more complete team. ranking #3 nationally in defense and #19 in offense. whereas Baylor has the #3 offense nationally and the #23 defense. (h) Wisconsin wins on the intangibles: a Heisman contender. a Coach of the Year semifinalist. a fan base known to travel well. and the fact that it behooves college football — all of it — to have a Big Ten conference that’s playing well and duly respected for it. The Big 12 will already have that angle covered with #3 TCU. 4. Smart People Believe Wisconsin Could Make the Playoffs. Is this case for Wisconsin only being made on The Huffington Post? No. Besides ESPN. The New York Times has registered its support for the Badgers. noting two weeks ago that “recent performance” could be considered by the CFP committee to justify saving a #4 spot for the Badgers this January. But it wasn’t just journos with professional reputations on the line who saw the Badgers as a possible playoff entrant. it was rich guys in Vegas with big-time money at stake. Prior to Wisconsin being named #13 on Tuesday — rather than the #10 or #11 many expected based on the Badgers’ placement in the AP and Coaches’ polls — the three top oddsmakers in Vegas gave Wisconsin 33-1. 35-1. and 40-1 odds to make the CFP. which sound like pretty long odds until you consider three things: (1) those are the eighth-best odds of any team in the nation. meaning that Wisconsin is properly in the playoff conversation. even if they’re on the periphery of it; (2) those odds don’t take into account this Saturday’s games. meaning that a Wisconsin win over a Top 5 opponent (however hampered by the Barrett injury). coupled with a Big Ten championship. could move those odds substantially before Sunday’s final CFP selection; and (3) of the seven teams with better odds than Wisconsin to make the playoffs. (a) Wisconsin only needs to outperform four of them to get into the CFP. and (b) at least one of those teams (Alabama or Missouri) has to lose on Saturday. while another (Ohio State) would have fallen behind Wisconsin if a Wisconsin win makes this whole Wisconsin-to-the-CFP conversation necessary. And as already noted. three more of those seven teams — Oregon. Baylor. and Florida State — will be playing Top 15 opponents this weekend. making the possibility that one of them loses a very real one. In other words. we can look at what some very smart people are saying and see in their words more than a glimmer of hope for the Badgers if they win on Saturday.
sports,Shaquem Griffin Becomes First One-Handed Player Selected In NFL Draft,Shaquem Griffin is the first one-handed player to be picked in the NFL draft. The Seattle Seahawks took the linebacker with the 141st overall pick Saturday. Griffin lost a hand when he was 4 years old due to a congenital condition known as amniotic band syndrome. A first-team All-American from the University of Central Florida. Griffin hasn’t allowed the loss of his hand to deter him from becoming one of the best football players in the country. At the NFL scouting combine back in February. Griffin performed 20 repetitions of 225 pounds in the bench press using a prosthetic attachment in place of his amputated hand. The 22-year-old ran the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds. the fastest time for a linebacker in over ten years. according to ESPN. Griffin joins his twin brother Shaquil. a cornerback. who was drafted by the Seahawks in 2017. “This is not the end of my road ... it’s only just the beginning.” Griffin told ESPN. “And I’m going to keep proving people wrong.”
sports,Carlos Gomez Hit A Triple. Then The Benches Cleared (VIDEO),Benches cleared at PNC Park on Sunday after Brewers outfielder Carlos Gomez hit a triple off the center field wall. Gomez appeared to admire the hit as if it was going to be a home run before racing to third base. That didn’t seem to sit well with Pirates pitcher Gerrit Cole. who had some words for the Milwaukee All-Star. Then. everything escalated. Cole and Gomez were quickly separated as both dugouts rushed over. But then Gomez and Pittsburgh’s Travis Snider went after each other in the infield. Some punches were thrown and both bullpens spilled out onto the field. The chaos eventually died down while Gomez and Pirates catcher Russell Martin needed to be restrained. Gomez. Snider and Brewers bench coach Jerry Narron were all ejected.  After the Brewers won 3-2 in 14 innings. Gomez told reporters that he did not regret his actions.  “I’m not apologizing for nothing I did today. This is my job. I’ve been doing it for eight years like that. They know I play like that. It’s not to disrespect nobody.” Gomez said. reported Adam McCalvy of MLB.com. “I heard something I don’t like. I don’t think [Cole’s] the one who tells me what I have to do. I don’t tell him what he needs to do to pitch.” Meanwhile in Pittsburgh’s locker room. Cole said he told Gomez that he “grabbed the ball from Harrison and I said. ‘If you’re going to hit a home run. you can watch it. If you’re going to hit a fly ball to center field. don’t watch it.” per MLB.com. “I didn’t curse at him. I didn’t try to provoke a fight. I was frustrated. and I let my emotions get the better of me and I ended up getting one of my teammates hurt. so I’m not too thrilled about it.” As for Martin. he accused Brewers catcher Martin Maldonado of throwing a dirty punch.via the Associated Press.  “I’ve never sucker punched anyone in my life. so I don’t know what was running through his mind there.” Martin said. “But I have been sucker punched. and I know after having that happen to me that I would never do it to anyone else.”

Some of it was arguably a result of generational differences. but the racial factor certainly played a significant role as well. On Saturday. Newsday’s Jets beat writer Kimberly Martin shared some proof of that in the form a letter she received from a reader. The letter contained hateful. racist language about Cam Newton and black people in general. In the letter Martin posted to Twitter. slurs are tossed around a number of times along with horrible stereotypes and lazy comparisons. Martin explained to her followers that the hateful language in the letter. unfortunately. doesn’t surprise her. These points of view. she said. are more prevalent than people may think. Posting the letter. she tweeted. is “a reminder that racism. bigotry + prejudice are still rampant.”

And if you need proof. we point you to Emmanuel Casasola. the man who believes a San Antonio high school should change its name in honor of the 66-year-old. Casasola started a petition online on Nov. 12 to change the name of Robert E. Lee High School — named after a Civil War-era Confederate general. for the two of you who don’t know — to something honoring the Spurs coach. Casasola told the San Antonio Express-News he decided to start the petition in light of a number of academic institutions that have distanced themselves from Confederate figures and symbols. “I’m not advocating to change the name. but if it does change. it should be to honor one of our own.” Casasola said. In the petition. Casasola made sure to clarify that the petition wasn’t just a comedy stunt. “I know this may come off as a joke. but I am being completely serious.” Casasola affirmed. “He is loved and revered all over the country as the best coach in all of sports and one of the greatest coaches of all time.” As of Thursday morning. the petition had already garnered over 1.500 signatures in the week since it was launched. Popovich. however. told the Express-News that he wasn’t too fond of the idea. “You got to be kidding.” Popovich said. “Are you serious? I would hope that you would use all your muscle or whatever you have to squash that ridiculous idea as soon as humanly possible. Can you please do that for me? Squash that ridiculous idea right now. That is laughable.” Then again. did you expect any other type of answer from Popovich?

sports,For All They’ve Been Through This Year. The Thunder Deserve This,In the NBA. mid-February is supposed to be a kind of reprieve — All-Star Weekend lets players and coaching staffs catch their breaths. before gearing up for the final push of the regular season and the climbing pressure of the impending postseason. But for the Oklahoma City Thunder. the 28 days between February 10 and March 8. 2016. were filled with a series of shots to their collective solar plexus. as tragedies kept slamming the team week after week. First. it was the death of Ingrid Williams. assistant coach Monty Williams’ wife. who was beloved throughout the NBA for her heart. humility and humanity. Seen as a source of comfort to players wherever her husband happened to be coaching. Ingrid. mother of five. was killed in a head-on car crash. after the other driver. who reportedly had methamphetamine in her system. lost control of her speeding SUV. In the days following her death. Ingrid was described by Oklahoma City’s Anthony Morrow as an “angel”; her death prompted superstar Kevin Durant to break down into tears during practice when the crash was mentioned by a reporter; and her memorial service brought far-reaching members of the NBA family together in Oklahoma. as Monty delivered a moving eulogy. asking all present for prayers of peace and forgiveness for the other driver. “Let us not forget that there were two people in this situation. and that family needs prayers as well.” Williams said that day. “Life is hard. It is very hard. And that was tough. But we hold no ill will toward the Donaldson family. and we. as a group. brothers united in unity. should be praying for that family. because they grieve as well.” Then. it was the passing of minority owner Aubrey McClendon. who was partially responsible for bringing the city its first major professional sports team. Finally. it was the fatal shooting of Demetrius Pinckney. brother of team lightning rod Dion Waiters. Pinckney was caught up in the crosshairs of a shooting rampage in the streets of Philadelphia. He was just 21 years old. If the Thunder franchise were a completed jigsaw puzzle at the start of the season. ready to recover from last year’s disappointing finish and raring to compete for the 2016 title. mid-March saw the pieces of the puzzle knocked out of place and strewn across the table. Williams missed time this spring. as did Waiters. And the club known for its immeasurable energy — Russell Westbrook’s post-basket roars of excitement. the home arena crowd — was suddenly shrouded in black. forced to try to continually claw its way back to relative normalcy as fate kept knocking it down a peg. When the Western Conference Finals began a little over a week ago. few gave the Thunder a fighting chance against the high-power. high-volume offense of the Golden State Warriors. Sure. everyone expected to be entertained by Russell Westbrook and wowed by Kevin Durant — but the thought of OKC stymieing Stephen Curry? Of muffling Draymond Green? There just wasn’t a conceivable blueprint for how they were to even attempt that. Golden State was that good. that machine-like. that universally favored. Today is Thursday. May 26. The Oklahoma City Thunder have a 3-1 lead on that good. machine-like. recently universally favored Warriors squad. Waiters is playing inspired basketball — shooting nearly 43 percent from beyond the arc this postseason — and the club even got to show off for its assistant coach. as Williams. who’s taken a leave of absence. surprised the guys by attending the Thunder’s first-round rout of the Dallas Mavericks last month.  Just getting to this point. on the brink of eliminating Golden State. has shown the kind of courage that seems innate in this team’s DNA. It’s been attacked from all sides all year. and even now it’s still coping with the aftermath of a hellish 28 days that were more reminiscent of the denouement of a Shakespearean tragedy than of an NBA season. So this series. with the odds stacked against them? A kicking. aggressive Green? A supposedly unstoppable Steph Curry? Well. that’s on-court stuff. That’s easy. That doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. The Thunder have been through worse. And while stopping The Best Show In Basketball is certainly a feat. it’s merely a testament to the strength they’ve already proven they possess in more important instances this spring. It’s just the most recent reminder of these guys’ ability to unite when all hell breaks loose — a reminder of their mental ferocity and of their knack for maintaining some equilibrium amid such relentless instability. They’re one game away from history. Five wins away from a title. It won’t be easy. even if they do manage to knock out Golden State. But there’s no doubt that they’ve already dragged themselves and each other through the hardest part. Say what you will about the Warriors. but the Thunder deserve this. 
travel,Traveling For The Joy Of It,“Travel is at its most rewarding when it ceases to be about your reaching a destination and becomes indistinguishable from living your life.” -Paul Theroux. Ghost Train to the Eastern Star “Above all. my dear Lucillus. make this your business: learn how to feel joy.” -Seneca. Letters from a Stoic It was another one of those days. By 12:30 that afternoon we had already carried our 40 lbs packs for 6 hours in the oppressive pre-monsoon heat. When we stopped for tea and some vegetables to cook for dinner. a few opportunistic locals took advantage of our situation and charged us 5x the normal price. After. we bushwhacked for an hour through the valley in search of a campsite. We spent the next two hours underneath the sweltering midday sun staking out a herd of water buffalo. Their grazing pattern had cut us off from our packs after we had dropped them to canvas the area for a suitable campsite. Every time we attempted to reclaim our packs the herd’s matriarch—twice the size of a cow with a calf in tow and two black orbs for eyes that glistened with a horrifying. primal terror—immediately locked onto us and threatened to charge. Later that night we had fled our campfire when a demon moth descended on us out of the night. It was the size of my fist. buzzing as loud as a helicopter with bulging bug eyes that glowed a devilish red in the light of my headlamp. I was convinced it wanted my soul. The previous two nights hadn’t been much easier. The night before we had regretfully become a small village’s evening entertainment. Despite searching out a secluded spot down a hill in an abandoned rice paddy we found ourselves quickly surrounded by chattering locals with a very different concept of privacy than us. They pointed. screamed and laughed at everything we did. At first we found it charming. Two hours later we were exhausted and pushed to the end of our nerves. We were relieved when the setting sun finally forced even the most curious kids to head for home. We could finally start cooking. The night before that had been our first on the trail. It would end up being a 38-day journey across Nepal. Except for the 3 long days it took us to get into Nepal’s interior. the entire journey would be by foot. In those first three days we had traveled by jeep. car and bus on nauseating mountain roads (some were no more than dirt trails). navigated chaotic. smog-choked bus stations and overnighted in a cockroach-infested border town (they were MASSIVE). Beginning our trek had been a relief…until we heard thunder. We raced to set up camp in a vast river gorge as we felt the first few drops of rain. The gorge was picturesque but it turned out. not a practical place to camp. The violent thunderstorm that rolled through minutes later transformed the gorge into a massive wind tunnel. Our tent was completely exposed. I was terrified I’d be blown away. Why am I here? One of the allures of travel is that it offers immediate answers to some of life’s existential questions. When I’m on a trek my purpose is mapped out for me. I have a clear goal: walk from here to there. It’s what I’ve come to do. That’s why I am here. Once I begin a trek. it becomes urgent I figure things out. Trekking is strenuous and all-consuming. I have limited supplies. I’m in an unfamiliar country. No one speaks my language. Food. water. shelter. the weather. the way—these are matters of survival. a puzzle to figure out. I have little energy left for anything else. Worries of tomorrow are replaced by the pressing needs of today. Everything feels significant. When I’m trekking I can measure my progress in the time it takes to pull out my map. How I’m doing is easily quantified in days left. miles walked. and meters climbed. I feel the forward momentum with every step I take. I can see it too: landscapes. villages. fauna. flora—it’s all changing. reminding me that I’m on the move. When I look back at the trail behind me I can see where I started and how far I’ve gone. It’s incredibly satisfying. It’s easy to get lost in these feelings of purpose and progress. It’s one of the reasons trekking (and traveling in general) is so addicting. Problems arise when I begin to take my goal too seriously. When I forget that where I’m going is only meaningful because I chose to go there. I’ve noticed a familiar feeling arises at end of every trek I take. Like a flame reaching the end of a matchstick. purpose and its hypnotizing glow of progress vanish back into the darkness as quickly as it had dispelled it. Meaninglessness and directionlessness creep in. I feel lost. I have no map to consult. The feeling can last hours. days. even weeks. Where am I going? I find that the difficult moments of a trek tend to also be the most truthful. Climbing yet another mountain pass from the valley floor. trudging for hours on a slippery donkey trail that heavy rain has transmogrified into a river of shit. watching my pack (with everything I own in it) roll off a ledge and free fall down a ravine. shoveling water out of my tent in a thunderstorm—in these moments it’s painfully clear to me that where I’m going doesn’t matter in the slightest. What am I doing this for? Trekking is always bringing me back to this question. Its demands are too brutal to ignore it for long. One of the risks of travel is its temptation to substitute a destination for a purpose. That I’ll mistake what’s urgent for what’s important and allow myself to be lulled to sleep by an illusory sense of progress. That I’ll become satisfied with crossing places off an imaginary todo list. That I’ll forget to ask: What am I doing this for? Work. Relationships. Hobbies. I’ve been unhappiest in my life when the question has gone unasked for too long. It’s incredibly comforting to feel like there’s somewhere important to be and that I’m on my way there. It’s driven me before.
travel,The 10 Steepest Streets In America,Think San Francisco has a monopoly on hellishly vertical inclines? Think again. Fixr. an online network for small businesses. rounded up the top ten steepest streets in the U.S. into one neat infographic. causing a stir of debate among seasoned travelers. ambitious cyclists and opinionated hill-climbers. San Francisco. it turns out. barely made the cut. clinging on to the number nine and ten spots. while the number one spot was handed to a restricted access road in Hawaii. The Big Island's cliffside road climbs up 800 feet in just six-tenths of a mile. It is so steep that access is restricted to 4-wheel drive vehicles and people on foot. making its inclusion debatable. While it's hard to believe that the ten steepest roads in America can only be found in three states (seven in California. two in Pennsylvania. and one in Hawaii). it's equally hard to argue with any of their heart-pounding inclines. 
travel,On the Merits of a Cigar,I just returned from Montreal where. thanks to the Jewish Book Council and to the Montreal Public Library. I spoke to a group of around 70 or 80 members. whose many intelligent questions kept the evening lively and the auditorium buzzing. Having never been to Montreal. my husband and I decided to extend our trip for a couple of days to enjoy the much heralded beauties of the city. We were impressed by the charming architecture. but more so by the kindness and generosity of its people. We walked a good part of the city. disregarding an unexpected snow storm. below zero temperatures. and a right foot that for no reason--other than. perhaps. being struck by the evil eye--ached so badly. I was forced to limp like a pregnant duck. On our only free evening. we decided to spoil ourselves and asked the concierge to suggest a "magnificent" restaurant. my choice of word. alas. "Europa!" His immediate response. "You can easily spend four hours there." he added. "It's an unsurpassed culinary experience." We combed and teased and dressed up for the occasion and walked six blocks in the slush and snow. yours truly hanging for dear life to my husband's arm. slipping now and then. imagining sacrificing my life at the feet of my ravenous stomach. I had not eaten much the entire day. other than chocolate. 99 percent cocoa. We arrived in one piece. pleased at the warm sepia décor and friendly ambience. We were seated under a red crinoline floor lamp that made everyone and everything appear flushed with joy and beauty. The bread was warm and delicious--yes I go to a "magnificent" restaurant and I report the bread. But then again. I gauge the quality of a restaurant based on the merits of its bread and butter. which to me is the best part of the meal. One course after another came. small morsels displayed like gems we thoroughly enjoyed--an added bonus. no sign of pork in anything. We were halfway through the meal. enjoying every bite. waiting expectantly for the main course. when the waiter approached with a cigar box. "Cigar for Madame?" Is this a joke. I wondered. offering the waiter a tentative smile. "Would Madame like a cigar?" she repeated. unfazed by my growing shock and annoyance at her doggedly serious expression. I glanced at the shiny wooden top of the box. embossed with golden letters that pronounced: "Cigars from Havana." or something to that effect. No. this was not a joke. I turned to the waiter and barked. "Do I look like someone who would light a cigar to cleanse her palette?" She snapped the box open. releasing a puff of aromatic smoke and revealing two appetizing cheese croquettes in the shape of cigars. "Perhaps Madame has changed her mind now?" Madame had changed her mind. but so did her appetite.
travel,America's Meanest Airlines: 2013,The 2013 Airline Quality Ratings (AQR) report -- released on Monday. April 8 -- shows that the U.S. Department of Transportation received a total of 11.445 complaints from disgruntled passengers in 2012. up from 9.414 in 2011. Most of the common complaints concern what the report categorizes as "Flight Problems." This includes issues such as flight cancellations and delays. The second highest number of complaints has to do with reservation. ticketing and boarding issues. while the third usually involves dissatisfaction with customer service. Dr. Dean Headley. associate professor of marketing at Wichita State University and co-author of the AQR report. partially attributes the increase in complaint rate to the rising number of Americans traveling by air. Mindset plays a role. too: "The actual number of complaints is much higher because customers seem more willing to complain." he said. Headley speculates that the growing number of consumer complaints directly relates to the American airline industry's economic growth. "Airlines have finally figured out supply and demand." he said. acknowledging airlines' efforts to reduce the number of available seats in order to improve their profit margin. "But it's a Catch-22. It's a good thing to have higher demand. but you'll make more people upset." Other revenue-boosting efforts have also helped improve certain aspects of air travel. "Only after [airlines] started charging for bags did the baggage-handling service improve." Headley noted. Customer complaints and mishandled baggage account for two of the four criteria used by Headley and his co-author. Dr. Brent Bowen. head of the Department of Aviation Technology at Purdue University. to calculate the airline quality ratings. The report also evaluates each airline's on-time arrival performance and involuntary denied boarding rate (the number of times an airline "bumps" a passenger). Fourteen American carriers were assessed on these four criteria for the 2013 edition of the AQR report. But whether or not the aviation industry will continue to grow their profits while satisfying flyer needs has yet to be seen. An unsteady economy and the possibility of sequester-related budget cuts to air traffic control services could threaten future progress. "Our system can only handle so much." Headley said. "When there's lower pressure on the system. everything works better. We've had a few good years -- the key is to keep it there while satisfying demand." Despite Headley's positive outlook. the 2013 AQR report shows that some airlines could stand to improve. The carriers listed below received this year's lowest AQR scores. earning them a place on U.S. News Travel's annual list of America's "meanest" airlines. Note: The Airline Quality Ratings (AQR) report does not categorize airlines as major or regional carriers. America's Meanest Regional Carriers 3. American Eagle Airlines AQR Score: -1.78 American Airlines's regional carrier saw improvement across all four of the categories evaluated for the 2013 AQR report. American Eagle Airlines has managed to better its punctuality. with 81.6 percent of flights making it to the gate on time in 2012 compared to only 76.3 percent in 2011. The carrier's denied boarding rate has also steadily declined. In 2010. American Eagle bumped 4.02 out of every 10.000 passengers; that number dropped to 1.07 in 2012. The airline has also reduced the number of bags mishandled per 1.000 passengers from 7.32 in 2011 to 5.8 in 2012; however. American Eagle still claims the highest mishandled luggage rate of all 14 major and regional airlines evaluated in the 2013 AQR Report. 2. SkyWest Airlines AQR Score: -1.88 SkyWest (which works with such major airlines as United Airlines. US Airways and Delta) saw an increase in the number of consumer complaints per every 100.000 passengers -- from 0.73 in 2011 to 0.88 in 2012. The uptick is understandable given the carrier's rising mishandled baggage and involuntary denied boarding rates. The rate at which SkyWest bumps flyers jumped from 0.68 instances per every 10.000 passengers in 2011 to 2.32 in 2012. The airline improved its timeliness. with 2.3 percent more flights arriving on schedule in 2012 compared to 2011. but that doesn't make up for the number of passengers who weren't allowed to board their plane. 1. ExpressJet AQR Score: -1.95 The AQR report shows that this regional carrier -- operating under American Airlines. Delta and United Airlines -- has some work to do in terms of improving its customer care. The airline tied with American Airlines for the worst on-time arrival performance. with a whopping 23 percent of its flights failing to land on schedule. ExpressJet could also stand to better its track record with checked luggage. The airline reported 5.52 instances of mishandled baggage per every 1.000 passengers in 2012. America's Meanest Major Carriers 5. Frontier Airlines AQR Score: -0.78 Frontier Airlines would benefit from better time-management practices. In 2012. the carrier's on-time arrival percentage fell just below that of the industry. with roughly 22 percent of Frontier flights landing late. But while it may let punctuality slide. Frontier trumps several other airlines when it comes to effectively handling luggage (only 2.22 bags per 1.000 passengers were lost or damaged in 2012) and making sure that passengers are not bumped from their flights. The airline reported a denied boarding rate of 0.78 instances per every 10.000 passengers in 2012. 4. Southwest Airlines AQR Score: -0.81 Very few flyers feel the need to gripe about Southwest Airlines. The bargain-rate carrier received fewer than 0.25 complaints per every 100.000 passengers in 2012. Compared to the rest of the industry. Southwest also performed above average in terms of timeliness and denied boarding rate. However. Headley's theory that checked-luggage fees lead to better baggage handling is proven here. The airline allows passengers to check two bags per person. free of charge. roughly three bags per every 1.000 passengers were lost or damaged in 2012. placing the carrier's mishandled baggage rate above that of the overall industry. 3. US Airways AQR Score: -0.87 US Airways has shown significant signs of improvement in its overall performance over the past couple of years. The carrier's on-time arrival performance jumped to 85.9 percent in 2012 from 79.8 percent in 2011. US Airways also decreased its denied boarding rates from 0.94 per every 10.000 passengers in 2011 to 0.68 in 2012 (better than the industry average). But US Airways still received the third-lowest AQR score of the 11 major carriers included in the 2013 report. and chances are that the airline will see its progress taper over the next couple of years due to its recent merge with American Airlines. 2. American Airlines AQR Score: -1.11 American Airlines has taken great strides to improve its reputation among flyers. bettering both its involuntary denied boarding rate and the number of bags lost or damaged in 2012. However. the 2013 AQR report shows a rising number of customer complaints and a slipping on-time performance average. In 2012. only 76.9 percent of American Airlines flights made it to the gate on time. down from 77.8 percent in 2011. As a result. the carrier received the second-lowest AQR score of the 11 major carriers evaluated in the 2013 AQR report. What's more. Headley speculates that American Airlines will to see its overall AQR score drop in the coming years due to its recent merge with US Airways. 1. United Airlines AQR Score: -2.18 United Airlines received the lowest AQR score out of all 14 major and regional airlines evaluated in the 2013 report. making it this year's "meanest" airline. The carrier saw its number of customer complaints per 100.000 passengers nearly double from 2.21 in 2011 to 4.24 in 2012. The carrier's increase in customer complains is likely the result of its merger with Continental Airlines (which was finalized in 2010). "This data year was the first data year following United's total absorption of Continental." Headley explained. "There are always kinks to work out. and these issues seem to be ones consumers feel are worth complaining about." United saw its performance deteriorate across the board in 2012. with its on-time arrival percentage dropping and its denied boarding and mishandled baggage rates climbing.
travel,Vacation Bound! What to Do With the Pets?,My husband and I are growing up. We finally planned a vacation where we'll arrive by plane instead of by car. and sleep in a bed instead of a friend's futon. The kids are happy. my husband's ecstatic--everyone is on board...except the family pets. Four dogs. three cats. a bunny. a lizard. and one stately goldfish will be left at the threshold. As a mother to all our creatures. whether they walk on four legs or two. I know how displaced our pets will feel. As a professional dog trainer. vacation-season guarantees an inbox jammed with the usually queries. Do I know a good kennel? Could I recommend a house sitter? Do I ever board-and-train? While holiday rarely spells joy for the family pet. it doesn't have to be a four-letter word either. My clients routinely ask my opinion--not only for their dogs. but for their entourage of other pets as well. My answer is always tailored their individual situation. First consideration? The pets themselves: their age. disposition. and daily demands weigh heavily on the decision. Cage-bound critters can be easily cared for or re-located. Outline a "needs chart." detailing feeding and water. temperature control. and cleaning schedules. If you're re-locating your pet. remember to pack familiar bedding. dishes. heated surfaces. and embellishments. Even rodents and herps (reptiles and amphibians) can be disoriented and their health compromised if lifestyle changes occur too suddenly. Would your pet be considered live bait living in the wild? If you're planning to rehome your bunny. ferret. guinea pig. etc.. during your respite. choose a place that mirrors the activity level of your home. A sweet. gentle bunny can be overwrought by the sudden intrusiveness of young kids or the predatory interest of an over-zealous canine. Similarly. birds need security. consistency. and attention to thrive--especially in your absence. Social and interactive. they will become stressed and confused if thrust into a setting that is unfamiliar or chaotic. To insure your bird doesn't stress-pluck himself featherless while you're away. find a sitter to stay in your home or someone who is bird-savvy and loving to take your bird in during your vacation. Cats are also rooted in the constancies of everyday life. Like butterflies and bees. cats have a homing instinct and can become distressed and restless if relocated. Left free to roam in an unfamiliar location. most cats will try to escape and return to their home. When possible. find a respected pet sitter to stop by during the day (or twice if your cat demands affection) or board your cat in a professional kennel. Dogs are another story altogether. Similar in brain capacity to a human toddler. few dogs see the point in vacating their sanctuary and familiar routine. But vacation you must. so consider your options and chose the one best suited for your dog's breed. age. and lifestyle. Kennels Some dogs view the kennel experience like summer camp. They love the social factor. the freedom to do just as they please. and. believe it or not. the permeating smell of all things K-9. These adventurous dog types acclimate to the daily routine shortly after their arrival. Most kennels offer playtimes with staff and other dogs. and many will accommodate special diets. Ask around for a good kennel and check it out. Is the staff welcoming? Do the runs look clean and the resident dogs well cared for? Book your spot! Not all dogs view the kennel so fondly. however. We once left our rescue-shepherd Balderdash at a "doggie spa" overnight. and I'm convinced he thought we'd abandoned him. He didn't eat or drink during his stay and had a weeklong bout of stress incontinence. My rugs never recovered. Generally speaking. protective/territorial breeds. and dogs that cringe from social experiences will stress in any place that separates him from the safety and predictability of home and family. Home Boarding Some individuals offer boarding in their home for a small number of dogs. and often group the dogs to allow off leash socialization throughout the day. This can be a nice option for high energy. friendly dogs who welcome new experiences and the camaraderie of other dogs. Ask local veterinarians and other pet care facilities for a referral. and check it out ahead of time. Pet-sitters Pet sitters come in two varieties: those who stay in your home. and others who drop by throughout the day. While other pets can cope with one or two visits. dogs need a limit of 3-6 visits a day depending on their age and disposition. I prefer sitters who can live in my home while I'm away. If you have multiple pets that will be further stressed if separated. or a dog who prefers the constancies of home. a pet sitter can be a great option. Invite your pet sitter in to walk your dog ahead of time so he/she is a welcomed face before your sudden departure. Ask around for referrals or seek certified sitters on line. Board-and-train A word of caution: many board and train facilities use electronic collars. also known as shock collars. to train their students. Theses devices issue an electronic shock to a dog's neck at the touch of a button. The purpose? Behavior management through "varied levels of electronic stimulation." While the dog is shocked for bad behavior. such as jumping. little effort is put into providing appropriate displacement activities for normal excitement. Positive reinforcement--the hallmark of any good dog-training regime. doesn't even come into the picture. I have too many good dogs traumatized by this approach. If you are tempted by this option. find a program. such as the one I used to offer. where a small number of dogs are welcomed into a home environment and are trained with positive reinforcement. Leave with Family or Friend Before leaving your dog with a friend. consider your dog and your friendship! Young puppies are demanding and destructive. If you're still housetraining. your friend may or may not keep up the regime. However. as dogs mature. they settle into their routines. and can be a pleasure to host. My eldest dog. Whoopsie Daisy. is a highly coveted pet-sitting assignment. But Whoopsie is an adaptor: "Here? Good. There? Good. Good. good. good. Let's eat then take a nap." Not all dogs transfer households so seamlessly. For homebodies who are more attached to family. structure and routine will not thrive in an unfamiliar household. Take-Along Of course. when possible. you might choose to bring your dogs along. Is this the ideal option? Maybe...maybe not. Depending on your dog's level of socialization. breed. and temperament. travel can be very stressful. Car rides are fun for many dogs. but a ten-hour marathon drive may test his mettle. And if you think airplane seats are uncomfortable. try flying in the cargo hold! Consider your dog's schedule once you arrive. as it takes a dog a few days to settle into a new routine. If your vacation will spell out long periods of isolation. it's often better to leave him home. No matter where you travel. or who you leave behind. the end goal is to make your pet's day consistent and routine. Select an option that will give you the greatest peace of mind. Now pack up. unplug. and enjoy yourself. Bone voyage!
travel,High Winds Cause Scary Landings In Northern Spain (VIDEO),Video footage taken in Bilbao in northern Spain shows aircraft dancing on the breeze -- even forcing one pilot to abort a landing attempt. With crosswinds steady at 40 miles per hour. The Telegraph reports. the aircraft seem to bounce around like marionettes before making rough touchdowns as gusts blew as hard as 80 miles per hour. Amazingly. the airport remained open. and no injuries or flight cancellations were reported. Footage of high-wind landings has become its own genre of travel video on the web in recent years. with footage taken at Dusseldorf's airport going viral earlier this year and thousands of "high-wind landing" clips from around the world available on YouTube.

travel,Glastonbury Festival's 'Pop-Up Hotel' Makes Us Actually Consider Camping,Music festivals typically (and unfortunately) go hand-in-hand with dodgy motels and semi-sturdy tents. plopped in barren wastelands of dirt and grime between chaotic days of music and dancing. So of course England would invent a classy alternative. At the Glastonbury Music Festival in Somerset. England. festival goers can now camp in luxury at The Pop-Up Hotel -- "pop-up" because it's literally made of tents. and "hotel" because. well. it costs almost $17.000 for the priciest room. The hotel exists only for the festival (which kicks off June 25). but it's got amenities that real resorts take years to refine. There's 24-hour security. a concierge with luggage porters and a tented dining room with professional kitchen. Need snacks delivered to your dwelling? There's "tent service" for that. too. Of course. not every tent costs a pretty penny. More budget-conscious fans can stay in the "10-foot yurt." which sleeps two people for almost $3.000. But the Tenthouse Suite -- with four bedrooms. two bathrooms. butler service and a mini bar -- will set you back almost 50 times more than a ticket to the Festival itself. ...not that we're counting.
travel,To Ship or Not to Ship Your Luggage,Wouldn't it be great if you could travel bag-free? There would be no bag-check lines. no waiting for luggage. no lost luggage and best of all. no restrictions. Well. it is entirely possible. And traveling with your beloved bicycle? That is possible. too. How? Ship it. Shipping Your Luggage: Shipping your luggage might be the ultimate indulgence. So you must be aware that first. it is not cheap. and second. you will have to pack and send your items a few days in advance. These four companies specialize in shipping luggage. www.luggageforward.com www.luggagefree.com www.sportsexpress.com www.theluggageclub.com Shipping vs. Checking Bags To really hone down on what the best choice is. you need to do the math. In general. however. if what you have is luggage that is overweight (50-70 pounds). you will be better off paying the overweight fees with your airline. If your bag is oversized (larger than 62 in/158 cm). that's when it is really worth shipping. For an oversized. overweight bag on a domestic flight. you can pay up to $400 extra. On an international flight. you simply cannot take the bag onboard. Comparing Rates Unfortunately. there is no set formula for knowing when to ship and when to take your bags onboard. There is however. a way of effectively comparing rates for both. At www.farecompare.com. there is a great chart that compares baggage fees for different airlines. Also. www.seatguru.com has comparison charts for shipping vs. checking your bags. Shipping luggage can get a bit messy. Be sure to research and compare your options before you make any decisions!
travel,Dirty Dozen Travel Myths,"Myths are true legends of actual facts that never happened." It is near the end of summer and we are all just coasting along until Labor Day. Many of us are now susceptible to believe things that just aren't true -- like campaign commercials! Travel is no different. Urban legends and false truism abound among us fellow travelers. Culled from my vast travel-related archives. here are my Dirty Dozen Travel Myths that don't seem to go away: Travel Myth #1 - The famous Dream Seat lives! No. I am sorry to say. it is not real. The utterly romantic belief that the person of your dreams (aka your future significant other that you will live happily ever after with...) will just plop down right beside you on that 45-minute commuter flight to Des Moines. or on that 13-hour flight between LAX and HKG is utter BS. No one likes to be drooled on. fella. And everyone gets bad breath after eating the mystery meat too. I know of no couple that has ever met on an airplane! Do you? Travel Myth #2 - You never feel the bobbing and weaving on cruise ships. Right... and I have this 20% annual rate of return investment vehicle for you too! Indeed. it has to be said. that for the most part. cruise ships are incredibly stable. Most have stabilizers and modern technological advances; but. different folks have different tolerances for the pitch (up and down) and roll (back and forth) movements of cruise ships -- especially during heavy high seas. Seasickness (aka motion sickness) is real and there is a big market for it -- on cruise ships! Travel Myth #3 - The airline brace position will save your life in the highly unlikely event of a airplane crash. Hmm. well. a lot of things might save your life -- like where you are sitting on the plane. whether you are drunk or not. whether the plane hits the ground at 600 mph or at 120 mph. whether it explodes into a fireball or not. whether you land in the water or into a mountain. whether the plane disintegrates midair. whether the plane is full of fuel or empty. whether your incident occurs in a rich country or a precarious failed state. whether you are flying with a CAA approved crew or not. etc. Yes. these things might decide your fate. But. putting your hands on your head and your head between your knees (if you can actually fit there with smaller and smaller seat sizes) -- maybe not so much! It could just be a Cold War era remnant from the duck and cover mentality (aka kiss your ass good bye). By the way. the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) itself claims that the brace position is designed to help minimize fatalities and injuries caused by flying debris in the cabin -- not in the crash itself. Travel Myth #4 - Everyone always needs an international driver's permit (IDP) when driving outside North America. Nope. you don't always need one. in fact you usually don't. Different countries have different rules. Most European countries. and former British Commonwealth nations like South Africa Australia and New Zealand (NB: Canada is in North America!). among others. you don't need one to rent or drive a car. A valid U.S. or Canadian driver's license is enough. For the most part. the IDP's issued by AAA. is nothing more than your own valid driver's license translated into different languages for local non-English speaking cops to be able to read! Travel Myth #5 - Your personal electronic devices will interfere with the plane's navigation systems. Utter hogwash! (But never argue with a flight attendant about shutting off and stowing your electronic devices.) Who amongst us hasn't inadvertently left them on for an entire five-hour cross country flight at some point? (And I have the roaming charges to prove it!). All those laptops and iPads. MP3 players and gaming platforms. iPhones and Blackberries. don't affect the airplanes electronics -- or they wouldn't be allowed period! There are twin non-electrical-related issues here: 1) people might not pay full attention to the flight attendants in times of emergency; and 2) those items. like any airplane item. risk becoming lethal projectiles in the event of an impact or sudden deceleration. It is all about safety (and until the airlines figure out a way to extract new fees from us) not the planes navigational systems. Travel Myth #6 - Those hotel key cards have all your personal information coded on them. Nope just another urban legend. Don't worry about losing them or someone hacking them either. All they have is a random alpha numeric code to open one door in the whole hotel. Travel Myth #7 - You can accumulate one million miles flying a year on your frequent flyer program. Well. not really. This is huge a myth among so-called road warriors -- wing-nut frequent flyer junkies who take flights to nowhere just to accumulate additional airline miles. Go figure? Maybe you can use an affinity credit card a lot to purchase other goods and services. but you certainly can't fly a million miles a year unless you are an astronaut. Just do the math: 1.000.000 miles divided by 365 days = 2.740 miles-a-day (at least six hours a day of actual time in the air) every day for a year! Nuff said. Travel Myth #8 - Train travel is always cheaper than air travel in Europe. Nope. not any more with so many no-frills discount airlines. both domestic and international. exploding on the scene over the past decade. I recently flew from Vienna. Austria (VIE) to Paris. France (CDG) for $20! Of course my bag cost another $30. but hey. it was still cheaper and faster. (It cost $110 and would have taken 13 hours by train.) Ditto for most other major inter-European destinations. Travel Myth #9 - You will be arrested for attempting to join the infamous Mile High Club during a flight. Well. maybe yes. but usually no. I would not attempt it in an Islamic nation that's for sure... But. according to the Civil Aviation Authority again. there are no specific laws that govern the matter. That said. various countries have their own laws governing public sex and in reality the flight attendants that I have talked to say go for it. but be discreet -- no screaming. yelling or kicking -- and be quick! And never try to join the club by yourself in your seat! Travel Myth #10 - The more megapixels a digital camera has the better. That's just our bigger is better. and more is always good mentality speaking -- it's not true after a certain point. As you may know. megapixels are those tiny dots that make up a picture. so a five-megapixel camera captures photos that make up five million tiny dots of information. Two things: It doesn't matter what the megapixel size is if you take a bad photo. It will always be a bad photo! Plus. the bigger the megapixels size the bigger the memory card needs to be to hold all your photos. But. here's the bottom line: megapixels only really matter if you are either cropping out large portions of a photo or making a giant poster-sized enlargement of one. So. unless you are a pro. having a four or five megapixel camera is perfect. The rest is all marketing hype. Travel Myth #11 - Travel now while you can before you have children because you can't travel afterward. This is just plain bullsh#t! Of course you can still travel with them. but yes you will have to slow down and adjust to their level. lower your expectations about what you can and cannot do and travel is obviously much easier and less expensive without them -- but you still can. As the real truism goes: "Traveling with my partner is a real vacation. traveling with my kids is a real adventure." Travel Myth #12 - There is a right way to travel. Wrong. there is no formula right way to travel. There is no cookie cutter one-size-fits-all approach to travel. Some folks love to sleep on the beach. while others are adrenaline junkies. Some like the tried and true and hang with the herd. while others head off to parts unknown by themselves off the beaten path. Some folks just need a long weekend to get a vibe. while others need to immerse themselves for a whole year. There is no right way to travel. and one is not better than the other; this is the ridiculous traveler versus tourist debate. Like appreciating art. it is wholly subjective. personal and an individual experience. What are your top travel myths. We can't wait to hear them...

travel,Federal Air Marshals Face A Hostile Work Environment. ABC News Reports,An ABC News report that aired on Tuesday night investigates the apparently crazy world of air marshals. According to the report. there is a "striking" lack of professionalism within the agency. Current and former air marshals spoke with the news outlet telling them. "Managers at the Federal Air Marshal Service regularly made fun of blacks. Latinos and gays. took taxpayer-paid trips to visit families and vacation spots. and acted like a "bunch of school kid punks." Former air marshal and "whistleblower" Steve Theodoropoulos spoke with ABC and told them that culture within the agency is "hate African Americans. hate females. go after gays and lesbians cause we don't like the way they think." Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida asked for an investigation into the air marshal program two years ago. He told ABC. "Sooner or later. if you do not have people operating at their peak efficiency. then you take the risk that a terrorist is going to get away with his dirty deed." The 118-page report. which is to be made public on Thursday. reveals that there is "a great deal of tension. mistrust and dislike between non-supervisory and supervisory personnel in field offices around the country." According to CNN. which also obtained a copy of the report. the investigation reveals that "employees' perceptions of discrimination and retaliation are extensive. and we heard too many negative and conflicting accounts of events to dismiss them."
travel,Paris Journal V: Croque Monsieur,The croque monsieur is a delicious sandwich made from ham and melted cheese. You can also have the jambon which is composed of ham and fresh baguette. freely spread with butter. But one of us is going to croke one day. monsieur and it's something that could happen precisely when you are eating either of these delicious sandwiches--or for that matter the Croque Madame which is made with an egg. There's a little joint down at the corner of St Michel and St Germain right by the Odeon stop. You're mouth waters when you look at the piles of freshly made jambons behind the counter. You know how fresh they are since the place has a huge turnover. Once you crunch into the bread and soft interior oozing with butter. you're overtaken by an experience that's akin to passion-- the temporary madness that leads to consummation. That very experience of abandon is similar to what one experiences when eating a freshly cooked croque monsieur (croque monsieur literally means "crunch. mister"). Who knows? Pheromones may even be released. However it's precisely in a moment like this when one is filled with the rapture of everything that makes France great (among these yet not limited to bread. sweet butter and ham--oh yes and brie). that one forgets to chew. And all of a sudden the bread (particularly if it's the baguette of a jambon) is lodged in one's trachea and yes. there on the Odeon one may croke monsieur. But what a way to die!
travel,TSA Agent Questions Passenger Over Status Of D.C.'s Statehood,Plenty of things can trigger a slowdown in the security line at an airport. Whoever thought the status of Washington. D.C.'s statehood would be one of them? This. after traveler (and D.C. resident) Ashley Brandt says she was delayed at the Phoenix airport last week after presenting a TSA agent with her D.C. license to confirm her identity. As the TSA requests a "state-issued photo ID." and Washington D.C. isn't a state but a federal district. Brandt says she was subject to extra inquiry. In a recollection of the incident to the Washington Post. Brandt says the agent looked at her ID. shook her head. and said. “I don't know if we can accept these ... Do you have a U.S. passport?" Brandt didn't present a passport. leading the agent to call for a superior. “I started thinking. ‘Oh my gosh. I have to get home. Am I going to get home?'" Brandt said. Fortunately. reports NBC Washington. the supervisor signed off on her ID and Brandt made it home on time. In the midst of the incident. Brandt's boyfriend. who was with her at the time. tweeted. "Holy. S**t. TSA @ PHX asked for gf's passport because her valid DC license deemed invalid b/c 'DC not a state'." The tweet went viral. prompting D.C.'s House delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton to author a letter to the TSA calling for "corrective action." But in all fairness to the TSA. as Mother Jones notes. the matter was cleared up pretty quickly. In a statement to The Huffington Post. a TSA spokesperson confirmed licenses from Washington. D.C. shouldn't pose a problem at TSA checkpoints. “A valid Washington. D.C.. driver's license is an acceptable form of identification at all TSA checkpoints. When issues arise at the checkpoint. TSA officers work to make sure facts are gathered and quickly resolved to avoid future confusion.” This story has been updated with comments from the TSA.
travel,Disney's D23 Expo: Richard M. Sherman & Alan Menken - Together Again... For the First Time!,Disney's D23 Expo. which is taking place August 9-11 at the Anaheim Convention Center in California. offers visitors an immersive weekend into every aspect of The Walt Disney Company. One of those great immersive experiences this year is happening on Saturday. August 10 at 6:30 pm PST - the "Richard M. Sherman and Alan Menken: The Disney Songbook" concert. If you are planning on attending this year's expo. this concert is a must-see. Together Sherman and Menken have won a combined 10 Academy Awards for their work with Disney. and have composed music and songs for more than three-dozen Disney feature films. over two-dozen Disney Park attractions and half-a-dozen Disney musicals on Broadway. As they have said being Disney composers is "a very exclusive club" and that they have "an admiring and supportive friendship." Recently. these two Disney Legends sat down to discuss their upcoming concert and performing with each other for the first time. "I can't express how excited I am that my esteemed friend Alan Menken and I will be sharing the same bill for the very first time." said Sherman. "Alan is an incredible talent. and I know we're both thrilled to be performing for Disney's most ardent fans... I can't wait to be a part of what promises to be a very special night for all of us." "Richard Sherman and I share so many things; our cherished association with The Walt Disney Company. the blessing of having the opportunity to share our musical talents with 'children of all ages' and a genuine mutual admiration--but one thing we've never gotten to share is a concert stage." said Menken. "I can't think of anyone I'd prefer to share that stage with. Richard. along with his [late] brother Robert. wrote songs that filled my formative years with joy and fantasy. And. all these years later. I can say with complete honesty that there is no one I've met in our business who is more warm and generous than my friend and fellow songwriter. Richard Sherman." For this concert Alan said. "I am looking forward to sharing songs that people are familiar with and that they have so much investment in and songs that they never have heard of. These are songs that are so tied to the movies; they are not slotted in randomly. Each song encapsulates the movie's time. feel and characters. There is no cynicism to the Disney songbook." Alan talked a little about the whole creative process. He said that the story doesn't really get written without the composers. One of the rules of storytelling is to make sure the audience is clear on what function the song will have in the movie. Sometimes it's sincere; sometimes it's tongue and cheek. They [the audience] need to make sure that the attitude. style and genre is very clear. Alan pointed out that one of the songs that he was very proud of was "Will The Sun Ever Shine Again." He said. "This song was written close the 9/11 event. It captured our emotions and the emotions of everyone at the studio. I loved "Gospel Truth." a song that opened up "Hercules" and "If I Never Knew You" from "Pocahontas" - we lost that song the first time around. but we got it back." For this concert. as well as others. Alan said that it's always a challenge picking out just the right material for an audience. He said. "Disney did have some requests of their own. the biggest challenge was which unknown songs or cut songs do I want to put in and contextualize for the audience. " "The same thing for me." said Richard Sherman. "We have so many to choose from. but we try to do a sampling of various things over the years. It's like looking over my children deciding which ones to take on the outing." How the "Richard M. Sherman and Alan Menken: The Disney Songbook" concert will unfold Alan said that they would just be at the piano. playing and turning and talking to the audience. Richard interjected. "I will take a turn and then Alan will take a turn and then we are going to do a very special thing and get together and compare a little bit about our histories. what our favorite pieces are - some of our most endearing pieces to us personally." Alan followed-up by saying. "That the concert will be a peek at some of our non-Disney things too." Alan and Richard have been involved in more than their fair share of composing for Disney musicals. so when they if there were other Disney films of theirs they would be dying to see made into a theatrical production they both laughed and said. "Oh sure!" Just finishing up a run in Chicago and then heading to Boston. Richard has "The Jungle Book." Past stage productions of Sherman Brothers musicals included "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." which many think is a Disney musical. but is not. as well as the beloved "Mary Poppins." Richard continues to say. "I have a couple of other things. but I don't want to talk about them until they become a reality." "It would be neat to see 'Hercules' come [to the stage]." said Alan. "We are working on a cruise ship version of 'Tangled' - who knows if that will find its way to the stage. There is a limit to these things. You don't want to over do that." Richard followed up by saying. "So many factors have to happen before they become a reality. I have always felt nervous before talking about too many things unless they are really on the road to happening. It's a little dangerous because then they say. 'well what ever happen to...' when it doesn't happen it hurts a little. I am right Alan?" Alan responded by saying. Well. I tend to be a little bit of a blabber mouth." Richard said that 90% of the songs that they wrote for Disney's animated features were written for the characters in the story and only 5-10% of the time they knew ahead of time which actor who was cast in that role. He said. "For example. if we knew Maurice Chevalier was singing a song we would write a song for that character but one that sounded like one that Maurice would also sing. We had no idea we'd get the glorious voice of Julie Andrews to sing Mary Poppins. We wrote songs for Mary Poppins to sing. In Richard's words. "The message that Disney fans already know but I'll just say it - there is a wonderful thing called being positive in your life as opposed to being negative. Being on the upside of the coin. Both Alan and myself have been blessed with the chore of writing things for very upbeat ideas. They are not depressing. They are not cynical. They are positive. They have strong feelings of goodwill in them. People say they get joy out of our work and feel happy about it and that truly is my reward."

travel,Carnival Cruise Lines And Why Third Party Travel Insurance Pays,Carnival Cruise Lines has had a rough few weeks. but as difficult as Triumph's drift. Dream's electrical failure and Legend's propulsion problems have likely been on the Carnival Corp. PR team. these seaborne debacles have been harder still on the boats' passengers. By way of making amends. Carnival has offered its indignant clients small amounts of cash and credits for exactly the sort of future cruises they probably want to avoid. That said. Carnival didn't really have to offer the victims of their hospitality anything at all -- an argument. if there ever was one. for third party insurance. Because no one goes to a cocktail party and talks about how great their recent trip insurance was. this part of trip planning goes undiscussed and winds up being misunderstood. Most cruisers simply purchase the insurance packages offered by the cruise lines themselves. policies that often offer travelers far more resources if their own bodies break down than if the ship does. Where cruise line insurance policies offer protection for both the traveler and the cruise line itself. third party insurance is all about the traveler. The major difference between third party and cruise line insurance policies: Third party insurance providers can't hide behind tickets. The idea of hiding behind tickets might conjure a strange image. but it is exactly what cruise lines do after disasters. Cruise tickets. after all. are binding contracts that limit cruise lines' liability while defining the scope of legal action that can be taken against them. Ask a lawyer how to sue a cruise line -- most of which fly foreign flags on their ships and operate in the grey area of international waters -- and prepare to receive legal advice in the form of a rueful head shake. Even after Carnival offered Triumph passengers fresh off that floating port-a-potty $500 and a credit for a future cruise for their troubles. cruise lawyers admitted there was little that could be done. Dream passengers received a refund equivalent to three days of the voyage and 50 percent off a future cruise. Legend passengers got $100 back on pre-paid shore excursions and 50 percent off a future cruise. These compensations were handed out to every passenger -- regardless of insurance -- at the discretion of Carnival itself. Having your company failing pay out on cable isn't great after all. Because Carnival credited the passengers willingly. insurance wouldn't much help. but what having a third party policy did give travelers was the knowledge that they had recourse. a way to recover the money they spent on a nightmare vacation. A decent plan from a respectable and easy to use service like TravelGuard or InsureMyTrip will normally run the customer about 5 percent of total trip cost. barely more than the insurance offered by cruise lines. For travelers going on luxurious round-the-world cruises. this is an investment in a dream. For travelers going on a Carnival cruise to the Caribbean. this is just a good idea: Carnival cruises are both affordable and accident prone. making a third party plan cheap and almost mandatory. Travelers with third party insurance also get a choice that is hard to put a value on. the chance to take their recovered money elsewhere.
travel,Northern Ireland Is Promoting Westeros Tourism With These 'Game Of Thrones' Stunts,At some point. every fan of HBO's "Game of Thrones" or George R.R. Martin's series "A Song of Ice and Fire" has fantasized about visiting Westeros. the fantastical continent on which most of the action in the series takes place. The scenery and architecture seems so much more beautiful. and the lives of the Westerosi so much more dramatic and exciting. than they do on plain old Earth. But for all it's imaginary natural beauty. Westeros affords its denizens lives that are. for the most part. nasty. brutish and short. They face all the calamities faced by Europeans in the Middle Ages. but also clash with dragons. warlocks and ice zombies. Also. Westeros doesn't exist. One place that does exist: Northern Ireland. And that's where pretty much any outdoor scene in "Game of Thrones" is filmed -- plus many of the interior scenes. too. True. the region has its own tragic history of violence. but at least you won't have to worry about any fire-breathing dinosaurs. The connection hasn't escaped the attention of many "Game of Thrones" fans. who have already started to visit the U.K. to get a glimpse of the landscape they love from TV. Several companies even offer tours of locations used on the show. And in recent weeks. Northern Ireland has been looking even more like Westeros than normal. That's because Tourism Ireland. which promotes tourism in both Northern Island and the Republic of Ireland. has been placing "Game of Thrones" memorabilia. such as dragon eggs and sign posts to prominent Westeros locations. in picturesque spots around the island in an effort to drum up excitement among the fanbase. Since "Game of Thrones" fans become more numerous and devoted with each passing season of HBO's show. there's a good chance this campaign will help boost Northern Irish tourism in the same way that "Lord of the Rings" boosted tourism in New Zealand. It should be noted. though. that Northern Ireland is just one of four places where "Game of Thrones" is now filmed: Iceland stands in for The Wall and the wilds beyond. Spain stands in for Dorne. and Croatia stands in for King's Landing. Meereen and a few other cities in Essos. So if you care more about the Martells or Daenerys than you do about Sansa or Brienne -- and. hey. no shame in that -- these stunts might not excite you one bit. Here are a few of the ways Northern Ireland is promoting itself with "Game of Thrones": All over the countryside. there are now signs to various Westerosi landmarks. The Kingsroad. for those of you less well versed in Westerosi geography than this reporter. is the longest road on the continent. It goes thousands of miles north from King's Landing. past the Inn at the Crossroads and the Twins. all the way up to the Wall. Arya traveled about half its length in season 2. disguised as a boy. Here's a signpost for Dragonstone. Stannis Baratheon's lair. We have to guess that the raven perched on top of is fake. Gotta be. right? This sign to Pyke is a little confusing honestly. Because Pyke. the capital of the Greyjoy's Iron Islands. is a very small island! Actually. come to think of it. so is Dragonstone. And this sign. at least. looks like it's pointing away from the sea. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? "Game of Thrones"-themed swords have also been popping up near the The pointy end of these sharp objects is luckily facing down. Some dragon eggs have been spotted at a local farmers market. We have questions about this one: Are these fertile dragon eggs. or petrified ones like those Illyrio Mopatis gave Dany for her wedding gift? And why are they so cheap? Sure. they're wildly expensive compared to chicken eggs -- but in "A Song of Ice and Fire." Dany learned that with the money she would get from selling one dragon egg. she could buy a ship or hire an army. They're far more rare and valuable than diamonds. The morning of Friday. April 24. the latest sign of Westerosi life popped up in Northern Ireland: giant's footprints It's a little hard to get a sense of the scale of these footprints in this photo... ...But they're really big. As they should be! The giants of the Lands Beyond The Wall are totally huge -- 20 feet high or more. So they have very big feet.
travel,Exploring the Wine Country of Beaujolais,It felt like we'd landed in the magic kingdom. It's always special to arrive someplace you've never been. without a lot of expectation. and to discover you really like it. But when that someplace turns out to be a roughly 30- by 9-mile stretch of land filled with rich green vineyards as far as the eye can see. when those vineyards are planted on gentle. rolling hills and set amid small villages. church steeples and chateaus. special becomes an understatement. We had planned to dawdle two days on our slow lane journey in the Beaujolais region. We stayed nearly four. My wife. Kathy. and I arrived in the village of Saint Lager for a noon lunch date on Thursday. My French language teacher in Boston. Emilie Paul. had a good friend who worked here. I wanted to learn about her work trying to create a regional Geopark. a UNESCO-sanctioned designation that helps draw tourists and interest to an area by celebrating the land. its geology. its related architecture. I soon learned much more. June sparkles here. Roses. poppies and other flowers bloom along stone walls and around the vines. The summer crowds have yet to arrive. Time. too. has its own pace. If the islands of the Caribbean have island time. Beaujolais has vineyard time. typically measured around wine tastes and easy talk. No one seems hurried. The hours amble by. Our first wine taste came before lunch. our second. third and fourth stretched until 7:30 in the evening. Kathy and I went to bed dead tired. slightly tipsy and very happy. We had sampled eight different wines at three wineries. eaten a tasty plat du jour of chicken in mushroom sauce in an outdoor courtyard at Restaurant Le Saint Lager. spoken French for more than seven hours straight. and toured the hills and vineyards on small. winding roads. thankfully leaving the driving to others. No question. it helped to have a fairy godmother of sorts. (That's mandatory in magic kingdoms. isn't it?) Anna-Maria Yordanova. who studied anthropology in Lyon with my teacher Emilie. not only ate lunch with us. but orchestrated our day to perfection. She was patient. kind. funny and truly proud of her adopted region. She helped us find a beautiful place to stay in a vineyard. She taught us how to use le nez in inhaling a wine's aroma. how to swivel the glass to let the wine breath. how to appreciate its taste. And she introduced us to two other wonderful people. Gabriel and Michele Savoye. he a third-generation vintner who recently retired but still grows enough grapes to fill 1.200 bottles of Beaujolais a year under his small label Domaine des Chaponieres.  Like his wife Michele. Gabriel is a teacher. a man who knows and appreciates the wine and history of a region filled with small. multi-generational. family wineries. We learned. for example. that there actually are three types of wine in the region -- Beaujolais. Beaujolais Village and Beaujolais Cru -- and two types of rock in the soil. granite to the north and limestone to the south. That the region's growers can plant only one grape. Gamay. which makes up about 85 percent of Beaujolais wines. That there are thousands of wine domains in Beaujolais. including some with tiny parcels of land. And much more. "For the wine you need three hands." Gabriel told us as we began our second real taste of the day. "two to hold the table and one to drink." Though we were lucky to have such a wonderful guide. it's not hard to explore this region on your own. The people are friendly. the wine tastes free of charge. To make the most of your visit. I'd offer these suggestions: Slow down Beaujolais is the kind of place in which life unfolds. Don't plan too much. Get a good map Kathy is a map nut. and this is her idea of heaven. You don't want to rely on a GPS system in Beaujolais. Explore the itty-bitty roads. They're not bad. And every turn seems to lead to another surprise -- a chateau. grazing sheep. an artisan's shop. a tasting room. Distances aren't great. Don't take the fastest route from A to B. Take whatever strikes your fancy. Enjoy the food For five months we relished the fresh vegetables and fruits of Aix-en-Provence's market. But when it comes to restaurants. this region seems to have the south of France beat. Remember. you're close to Lyon here. which for decades held the title of France's center of gastronomie. Look for where locals eat and use your nose. Enjoy the wine The wine-tasting rooms here are filled with good fellowship. good wine and lots of history. One thing we learned is that though the region is known for its red wine. its white wine is awfully tasty. too. We loved Caveau de Cru Morgon. opened as the first group tasting cellar of the region's wines in 1953. It's set in an 18th century chateau and has everything from massive wooden wine casks to a long wine bar. where you can order goat cheese ($2) or sausage ($8) to nibble on while you drink. And we particularly liked the wine at Chateau Thivin. the 6th generation winery from which we rented a gites or guest house to stay in. Try a hike or a bike ride Just to the west of Beaujolais is a mountainous countryside of grazing cows. forested trails and Queen Anne's Lace. It's possible to hike for miles along the ridge. descending into towns for a meal or a wine taste. Bikers are everywhere on the roads. too. and there are plenty of horseback riders. One hub of trails where we stopped and took a short walk can be found in St-Cyr-le-Chatoux. a village set at about 2.300 feet. Tourist offices in the area sell a hiking trail guide for about $8.50. Consider staying at a vineyard or in a chambres d'hotes You can find excellent hotels here. But this is the place to try something different. Stay amid the vines if you can. Our beautiful apartment at Chateau Thivin cost roughly $110 a night. It had a fully equipped kitchen. a porch. a view of Mont Brouilly. a tree loaded with cherries in the side yard. and lambs and goats jumping around just outside the gate. We loved it and would have stayed longer if it hadn't been booked for the weekend. The Practical Guide to Beaujolais. available in tourist offices for free. lists dozens of places to stay. Try something different from a desk clerk. "OK. I'm ready to move here." Kathy said our second day as we drove toward Oignt. a restored fortress and village dating back to the 14th century that's on the list of les plus beaux villages de France (the most beautiful villages in France). Well. maybe not ready quite yet. But we will surely return to this most charming region and. perhaps. leave our watches and clocks at home.

travel,17 Stress-Less Travel Lessons,I love making up little rules for myself when I travel. even if I break most of them. ("Just 30 more minutes online and then I'll go outside.") There is. though. one rule I come back to. over and over again. and it's flexible enough that it can be applied to almost any travel quandary: Be where you are. I often do not be where I am: I often be where I was. or where I am going. or where I wish I were. I have more trouble with being where I am. I came up with these sub-rules not because I would never consider beginning a trip in London at a Starbucks but because that is generally exactly what I want to do: There is nothing like comfort and familiarity after a long trip to a new place. These are the rules I try to follow to constantly remind myself to try harder. I've found that they offer incremental rewards: Even if I can't be 100 percent faithful to them. 100 percent of the time. I find that they reward me as much as I can be. I totally get it if someone just wants to conk out on vacation: That's why they call it vacation. and that's why God created delicious rum drinks that are even better when they include coconut and mini umbrellas. Generally. though. I like to travel. rather than vacation. Vacation is expensive and can become repetitive; travel can be self-sustaining. and is always interesting. whether it's a half-hour trip to a new neighborhood. a detour on an unfamiliar subway line. or three months in southeast Asia. Travel is interesting even when it is awful. even when it's Thanksgiving and you've spent the last 20 hours throwing up all over the floor of a hotel bathroom in Laos and then take a 10-hour bus ride to another part of the country. recovering just enough to have one bite of apple pie before throwing up again. (Thanksgiving 2009: It was awesome!) This is how I get as close to a thoughtful trip as I can. 1. There is never a good reason to go to Starbucks outside our borders.* If there isn't a better local cafe in the city you're visiting. you may need to change cities. 2. There is rarely a good reason to go to McDonald's outside our borders. (That said. I once saw a McDonald's in Beijing after four weeks in Russia and Mongolia and almost cried as I ordered my Chicken McNuggets and French fries. With happiness. to be clear.) Still. 3. There is absolutely never a good reason to go all the way to New York City and spend half your shopping money at American Eagle. Hollister. Sephora. or any other store you have at your local mall. 4. Before you get on the plane. pick 10 phrases and keywords in the language in which you are about to be immersed. and memorize them. My favorites. in order of necessity. are: "Thank you." "Sorry." "Yes." "No." "Excuse me." "Where are the bathrooms?" "How much does this cost?" "May I have the bill?" "Is there Wi-Fi here?" and "What time does this store close?" 5. There is no small thrill in being able to communicate an idea in an unfamiliar language (honest to God. I got the woman at the juice bar in Rio tonight to understand that I wanted my acai "to go" and felt like I'd won a Nobel prize.) Rosetta Stone costs about four times as much as it should but has good pronunciation drills. Duolingo is fun and free and nearly as good. And there are teenagers and college students worldwide looking to pay their rent by speaking in their native language with you over Skype for $25 an hour. 6. While you're on your trip. make a point of learning at least one new word every day and use it in conversation at least three times. even if it is completely obvious you are shoehorning the word "senha" ("password") into your conversation with a waiter for no particular reason. 7. Forget working out in the hotel gym. which is sometimes not an option and nearly always sad. What can be a total drudge -- keeping up a workout while you're traveling -- can be an awesome way to experience a place. Think: beach-running in Rio. hiking in the Alps. walking along a National Trail in Britain. Once you get there. they're all free. 8. Alternatively. pick up a pedometer and see how many steps you take on a normal day. (My number when I worked an office job was disturbingly low -- sometimes under 4000.) If it's under 10.000. try to double it each day of vacation. You'll get to see loads more up close and personal. and go back to your routine healthier than you left it. 9. Figure out three definitive movies from the country where you're visiting and Netflix them. Before I came to Brazil. I watched Central Station (beautiful and sad). Bus 174 (disturbing). and Elite Squad 2 (ditto). Rough Guides always has really good suggestions. or you can Google that country's recent Oscar submissions. 10. If you're too tuckered out to move one night. spend an evening not downloading and watching American programs but watching local TV. even if you can't understand a word. If nothing else. it should reinforce the fact that everyone. worldwide. loves a talent show. 11. Use Spotify to figure out the top 10 songs where you're headed. The results may be shocking. 12. Google "best [destination country] book 2012″ and if it's available in translation. read it. 13. Google "best poem [language of destination] [country of destination]" and find a few that have been translated to English. Pick one that might have some sort of relevance and commit the first 10 lines to memory. I was at the gym. weirdly enough. watching the Brazilian version of Sportscenter. when they showed these lines by Fernando Pessoa: "Quem tem alma nao tem calma." Which means (very roughly) "He who has soul lacks calm." Worth considering. 14. Figure out the classic English-language travelogue for where you're headed. When I was headed to the Balkans last year. it was Rebecca West's "Black Lamb and Gray Falcon." 15. Go somewhere only the bus goes. Lots of attractions are only reachable by rental car -- which can be (a) stressful and (b) expensive -- or by bus. rather than train. which is usually faster and easier. One bus-only example is Inhotim. which is an amazing art complex and botanical garden about 90 minutes by bus outside a city called Belo Horizonte. Dealing with a public bus in an unfamiliar place can be overwhelming and stressful. but it often provides access to places and people you won't otherwise encounter. 16. Try a "private room" on Airbnb. which basically means signing up for being temporary roommates with a local. I stick to apartments owned by women and try it out on quick trips -- maybe a weekend away. The prices. even in expensive cities. can be impossible to beat. except by a dorm bed in a hostel -- which. by comparison. often offers the chance to meet people just like you. from the same place that you just came from. Which is not the point. 17. If at all possible. learn to drive a stick.
travel,Panama City's Casco Viejo,Don't be surprised if you end up in Panama soon. Given the tremendous expansion of the national flag carrier. Copa Airlines. Panama City has become a critical transit hub for flying between the United States and South America. Earlier this year. after booking my fourth stop over in Panama's Tocumen International Airport in just three months. I decided that it was time to see more than just the airport and scheduled a 3-day layover. On the advice of a Panamanian friend. I decided to book myself into a hotel in the Casco Viejo. also known as San Felipe or the Casco Antiguo. The Casco Viejo is the Old City of Panama and it is the city's heart and soul. It is the place where Panama was born and its construction. undertaken in the late 1600's. reflects the classical Spanish style. The architecture. especially the main plaza. is reminiscent of the Old Towns of cities like Lima or Quito. Additionally. the Casco Viejo was built as a fortified city. much like Cartagena. Colombia. Thanks to the Panama Canal. over the last century. Panama developed as a major international trade hub. As the city became known for the skyscrapers that dominate its skyline. the Casco Viejo fell into a decadent state. The neighborhood was also heavily damaged during the US incursion into Panama in 1989. Over the past decade. however. private development firms have lovingly restored the area. Now. with a fresh coat of paint and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. the Casco Viajo is preparing to welcome a new generation of residents and visitors. When I visited in January 2013. the neighborhood was buzzing with construction. Workers were resurfacing the narrow roads with brick pavers. and people in hardhats (ironically the word for helmet in Spanish is "casco") outnumbered tourists. While there is plenty of construction. the neighborhood has once again become a leisure destination. Thanks to new boutique hotels such as the Tantalo Hotel with its hyperactive roof bar. the neighborhood is increasingly known for its restaurant and nightlife scene. During the day. visitors can spend hours wandering the streets. visit the excellent Panama Canal Museum. or grab coffee at one of a growing number of quality coffee shops. The only time I felt tempted to leave the Casco Viejo (other than to visit the Canal itself) was to wander over to the modern part of the city to try the home-style Panamanian cuisine at Barandas Restaurant in the Hotel Bristol. I'd seen the lifestyle guides and cookbooks written by Chef Cuquita Arias de Calvo all over town. and the food and homestyle atmosphere lived up to their promise. Although the Casco Viejo remains a city in transition. it is well worth a visit. whether its during a layover or during a trip to Panama itself. In addition to culture and history. there is the draw of the Panamanian people themselves. who are more than happy to host the growing throngs of tourists. When I left the Tantalo. the bell hop gave me a hug and made me promise to return. It's not everyday that one experiences that kind of hospitality. but it appears that the Casco Viejo is just that kind of place.

travel,Namibia Is Southern Africa's Desert Rose (PHOTOS),Churning through the bone dry Huab River bed. our clay-caked land cruiser chases the setting sun and some of Africa's most elusive inhabitants. "We're extremely lucky to run into such a large herd of desert adapted elephants." shouts guide Tristan Cowley over the roaring engine of what is likely the only safari vehicle within a hundred miles in this remote northwestern region of Namibia called Damaraland. After mounting a huge dune. we drop down to join Namibia's legendary desert survival specialists on their long march to water. Desert adapted elephants are so behaviorally attuned to the hyper arid conditions of the Namib Desert that they routinely travel up to 150 miles without drinking en route to watering holes near ancient. ephemeral riverbeds. They are also far gentler on the fauna they ingest than most elephants. perhaps innately understanding that knocking over the precious few trees and bushes that sustain them will be their ecological undoing. One would think that having over twenty of these mythical behemoths virtually to ourselves would be a rare treat. Only about five hundred desert adapted elephants remain in Namibia. the only place besides the fringes of the Sahara in Mali where they are found. But in this safe and serene country with more wildlife than people - along with spectacular desert landscapes. a ghostly coastline of sand. fog and shipwrecks. ancient artistic treasures. authentic tribes and some of the best safari camps and lodges in Africa - the exceptional is the norm. Which can mean refreshingly uncharted adventures for even the most seasoned of safari connoisseurs. Space is Namibia's ace Space is Namibia's ace. Twice the size of California. this former South African protectorate that finally attained independence in 1990 after a protracted guerrilla war contains only 2.3 million people. Only Greenland and Mongolia have fewer inhabitants per square mile. And with around 125.000 square miles (a remarkable 25% of its total land area) constitutionally set aside for nature reserves. Namibia feels like one giant super safari park. On a continent where nature is demarcated by fences and reserves. often turning locals into trespassers and in some cases. poachers on their own ancestral lands. Namibia's conservancy program is rare conservation success story. In one of the few places in Southern Africa that is completely unfenced. desert adapted animals can move and migrate unhindered and in relative safety because the local people are no longer their relentless adversaries. A conservation success story The happy result? In stark contrast to the rest of Africa. poaching has decreased to nearly negligible levels in Namibia. It's currently the only nation where free-roaming lion populations are actually increasing. It has the world's largest population of black rhino. many of which are being transferred out of national parks and into communally held conservancies. And is home to more than 25% of the world's remaining cheetahs. making Namibia the cat's meow for carnivore lovers. "Namibia is unique due to the fact that we have more predators and more prey outside our national parks than any other country." says AfriCat Foundation director Donna Hanssen as she feeds resident orphaned cheetahs their morning pound of bovine flesh. One of Africa's most progressive large predator research and rehabilitation centers. AfriCat is located in the heart of Okonjima Nature Reserve. three hours drive north of Namibia's compact. laid-back capital of Windhoek. Since opening in 1993. the foundation has rescued over 1000 cheetahs and leopards on Namibian farmland. successfully reintroducing over 85% of them back into the wild. Helping Namibia's cats come back Tall. blonde and packing a pistol. Donna Hanssen shows me around 55.000-acre Okonjima. carved from land her family once farmed. On these open plains. occasionally broken by the remnants of ancient sandstone outcrops. rehabilitated big cats hone their hunting skills before they're reintroduced into the wild. Volunteers from around the world help the Hanssens restore habitats and care for dozens of cheetahs and other rescued wildlife. And Okonjima guests can opt to stay in spacious traditional thatched chalets a short stroll from the original Hanssen-family farmhouse. Or splurge on the Grand African Villa. the ultra-luxurious bush hideaway overlooking a watering hole deep within the Reserve where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie stayed during the birth of their daughter Shiloh. Giant dunes & desert vistas Space (as in seen from space) certainly applies to the massive burnt orange dunes near Sossusvlei (pronounced SOSS-oo-vlay). a day's drive west of Windhoek. Rising out of the Namib Desert like silent. star-shaped sentinels. they tower as high as a 60 story skyscraper over Namib Naukluft Park. Africa's largest conservation area. I reach the summit of one dune just in time to catch the rising sun casting shadows on rows of silicon pyramids that mark the entrance to an ocean of sand flowing all the way to Namibia's notorious Skeleton Coast. graveyard of countless ill-fated ships throughout the centuries. Surreal as it is serene. this vast alien landscape feels like the enormous backdrop of a sci fi movie. which it has portrayed in numerous Hollywood and Bollywood blockbusters. Later that day I feel like the star of my own sci fi epic cruising through vegetated dune belts and endless stretches of golden grassy savanna on a quad bike in Namibrand Nature Reserve as ostrich and gemsbok race alongside in the distance. Probably the largest private nature reserve in Southern Africa at over 400.000 acres. Namibrand was created to help protect and conserve the unique ecology and wildlife of the southwest Namib Desert. one of the world's driest ecosystems. Out here amid some of the planet's most beguilingly unspoilt desert vistas. visitors can enjoy utter tranquility and pampering at five star retreats like Sossusvlei Desert Lodge and Wolwedans. a selection of small and elegant safari camps. proceeds from which go toward maintaining the Reserve. Retiring after a gourmet "bush dinner" to the veranda of my spacious wooden Wolwedans suite elevated above the dunes. I contemplate the darkest. most starlit sky I've ever seen. And strain to hear the lonesome call of a lone jackal serenading me from across the otherwise silent surface of this magical moonscape. Ancient art galleries If Sossusvlei and Namibrand feel like restorative desert isolation chambers. the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Twyfelfontein is ancient art therapy. Located in the barren Kunene Region of north-western Namibia. it contains possibly Africa's largest and finest collection of petroglyphs. etched in stone thousands of years ago by resident Bushmen (San). the original inhabitants of southern Africa. Hidden amid craggy sandstone mountains. their multicoloured rock strata and minerals exposed to the elements in fantastical shapes and colours. Twyfelfontein's 2500 prehistoric engravings depict handprints and abstract circular motifs. along with elephant. giraffe. kudu. lion. rhinoceros. zebra and ostrich. Admiring these alfresco galleries painted in blood. clays. ochre and plant extracts on boulders and slabs of red sandstone scattered about the hillside. I picture the ancient artists who created them. Perhaps during shamanistic rituals while their wild models followed age-old migration routes across the surrounding countryside - a tableau that has changed little in the thousands of years since. Today. thanks in large part to Namibia's pioneering program of land conservancies that have handed back control over wildlife management and tourism to the local indigenous communities. the descendents of those prehistoric animals immortalized at Twyfelfontein remain very much in the picture. Their freedom still largely unhindered. desert adapted black rhinos. lions. elephants and cheetah continue to roam across the breathtakingly beautiful open spaces of this African anomaly - a desert rose by any other name. If you go When to go: Late winter until the beginning summer (June till November) is the best time to come to Namibia. Winter (May to September) temperatures in the interior range from 65 - 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius) during the day. Summer (October to April) average interior temperatures range from 68 to 94 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 34 degrees Celsius) during the day. Getting there: Air Namibia flies to Windhoek from Frankfurt. as well as offering frequent daily connections for passengers arriving in Johannesburg aboard daily South African Airways flights from New York and Washington. Air Namibia also operates a limited internal service. Getting around: Navigating Namibia is remarkably easy for all levels of travelers. Roads are generally good for self-driving and routes well marked Safety: Namibia is a reasonably safe. peaceful country and is not involved in any wars. If you are alert and take some common sense precautions. you should have no problems. Should you require medical assistance. Namibia's hospitals are modern and capable of attending to whatever needs you may have. Where to stay: Home to the AfriCat Foundation. the Okonjima Nature Reserve offers four different styles of luxury accommodation ranging from a sumptuous private villa and traditional thatched roof suites to an exclusive self-catering campsite. The Wolwedans Collection features a selection of small and elegant safari camps. each set against a backdrop of exquisite desert scenery in the heart of the NamibRand Nature Reserve. Also set in the heart of the NamibRand Nature Reserve. Sossusvlei Desert Lodge offers spacious and serene five start suites complete with dramatic skylights for late night stargazing. as well as a selection of experiences ranging from quad biking to ballooning.

travel,A Day In The Life Of A Theme Park Character,It is July. a few summers back. at Paramount's Kings Dominion theme park near Richmond. Va. And as Patrick the Starfish. SpongeBob SquarePants' best cartoon friend. I am the goofy hero of the afternoon. Kids are lining up to shake my pink fleece flippers and -- hey. watch out there -- one keeps snapping the stretchy fabric of my Nickelodeon pantaloons. I'm not allowed to talk in here. so I can't tell this 6-year-old to lay off. I scan around for help. but inside my suit it's dark and hot. I check my key-chain thermometer: 104 degrees. My plastic starfish eyes are fogged. Suddenly. I feel lightheaded. It feels as if someone -- maybe SpongeBob. who is gyrating next to me -- has sucked the oxygen out of my suit. Stand back. I think. I am going down. My day as SpongeBob's TV series sidekick. Patrick the Starfish. gets started because I am nosy. I'm one of those who can't just relax and enjoy the magic of theme parks. I need to know what is really going on. How do the rides work? What's behind the landscaped sets? And. in particular. what's it feel like to be one of those friendly. furry characters who hug everyone and dance around? Is it fun inside the suits. or a nightmare of bad jokes. pushy parents and screaming kids? One way to find out is to see if someone will let me be one. After I'm turned down by a string of parks. Kings Dominion comes through. When I suit up. I'll be joining a small but important part of the amusement park industry. According to Sarah Lovejoy. Kings Dominion's manager of public relations operations. the park's costumed characters can end up hugging and high-fiving as many as 7.500 park visitors on an average summer day. At 5 feet 10 inches and 170 pounds. I'm too big to try out for SpongeBob. who's such a squat character that he demands an actor of about five feet. But if I agree to go through training and follow "character integrity" guidelines. I can spend one day in the role of SpongeBob's relaxed-fit companion. Patrick is big and dorky. and even though I don't have kids. I've seen his mug on coloring books and lunchboxes. Blundering along with Bob in series after series of deep-sea adventures. he is co-star of what Nickelodeon says is the most popular show in its history. 10:15 a.m. I report for duty. "Character actors punch a time clock." Lovejoy tells me sternly -- I am 15 minutes late -- "and then head on to one of the costume areas to suit up." 10:42 a.m. Lovejoy gives me a tour of the park. Highlights include the two areas for kids -- Nickelodeon Central and Kidzville -- where actors gear up daily for four to six half-hour-long "meet and greets" or "walks" in their suits. "I'm ready." I announce. Lovejoy glares. "It's going to take time to train you." she notes. "Not to mention fitting you in the suit." Do we get lunch? I ask. "Forty-five minutes." says Lovejoy. "But then it's back on the clock." 11:30 a.m. New-character boot camp. But today I'm the only inductee. Before learning the ropes. I limber up with some shin-touching and as many push-ups as I can do: nearly five. "A lot of this job has to do with endurance." says Amy Vest. who's in charge of characters and training and eyes me skeptically. "So we get mostly high school kids. It's tough. You'll have to crouch. you'll do a lot of hugging. and you'll dance. sometimes for as long as a mile. One time. during our parade. Patrick had an asthma issue and had to be brought back in." 12:10 p.m. After assuring Vest that. though I'm in my 50s. I don't need an inhaler. I am introduced to my gear in one of the park's top-secret suiting-up shacks. Vest refers to it as the Green Room. Visitors are strictly prohibited. and I can see why. It is crammed with disembodied character heads and hanging torsos. "They just got washed." says Vest about the torsos. "That's why they don't have arms yet." A sign on the wall says: IS IT LAUNDRY DAY? THEN MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE THESE THINGS IN THE SHACK: *SCOOBY'S HEAD *SCOOBY'S BELT *SCOOBY'S TAIL *SCOOBY'S FEET PODS I'm not worried about Scooby-Doo's feet pods. I'm concerned with the pieces of Patrick. 12:30 p.m. Lunch. Starfish or not. I down a fried shrimp sandwich from one of the park's fast-food joints. It's decent shrimp. but I feel like a cannibal. 1:04 p.m. Time to suit up. My costume is the color of Pepto-Bismol. Only it's a brighter pink. Since we performers are responsible for our suits. I spray down all the places that will touch my skin with a hospital-grade disinfectant known as TOR. 1:35 p.m. I step into giant fuzzy leg pods and pull up my mesh-style underwear and suspenders. Next come a pair of massive pea-green pantaloons. Patrick's head and body unit is heavy -- under the pink fuzz there's a structural shell. I need help from Vest and an assistant to hoist it over my head and get my arms through the knapsack-style harness inside. SpongeBob's suit. I'm told. is equipped with a personal fan. Nothing fancy like that in mine. It's like a tropical evening in here: dim. roughly the color of sunset. scraps of thread and duct tape hanging limp in the humid air. As a final touch. I attach some Velcro straps and slide my arms into the arm pods. which I try to flap using subway-style fabric straps. Voila. 2:25 p.m. Vest and her assistant explain the rules. No talking in the suit. No food. No gum. No running. No signing autographs (how could you grip a pen with a flipper?). And no embellishing the costume. "Once SpongeBob came out with a bracelet on." explains Vest. "that's supposed to go with Dino from the Flintstones. Someone was like. 'Hey. look. SpongeBob has bling!' I had him back in the shack in two seconds." The bracelet story reminds me of the ancient controversy over whether SpongeBob is gay. whatever that means in the world of cartoons. Since it touched off a national debate. I decide to get an opinion on it from the actor who. at this exact moment. is struggling to squeeze into the bottom part of SpongeBob's suit. She is Tiffany Vowell. 18. of Milford. Va.. a short and cute person about to be topped off by a rectangular cube of pockmarked. airbrushed foam. "Gay?" says Vowell. "I really don't think so. SpongeBob and Patrick are just friends." 2:56 p.m. We make the final preparations for our first meet-and-greet at Nickelodeon Central. We'll have to wave. shuffle to the music that seems to be blasting everywhere and. of course. pose for pictures. But because it's started to rain. we're going to have to do this under a canopy. And though trussed up in our suits. we're going to have to break the rules and run for shelter. How come? I say. What's wrong with a sponge and a starfish getting wet? "Your paint will run." says Vest impatiently. "And SpongeBob turns black." 3 p.m. It's time to exit the shack. Vowell offers some last-minute advice. "Don't be nervous." she says. "It's easy to stiffen up in there. But you don't want your movements to look forced." Suddenly there's a loud crack. It could be thunder. It could be part of my costume snapping as I accidentally bump into a wall. I can't really tell. 3:05 p.m. The rain is coming down in torrents. Our walk is aborted. says Vest. "It's just too wet. But stand by." 3:48 p.m. Due to the haze in my suit and the delay. I realize I've been dozing. How much time has gone by? I slip my hand out of one of my arm pods to check my watch -- probably only a couple of minutes. I think. SpongeBob and a friend are playing Monopoly to pass the time. Vest is checking the weather. No one has noticed my nap. 3:55 p.m. It's drizzling now. dry enough to make another try. I jiggle and shake my pods to wake up. My plastic eyeholes are small and scratched. Vest and SpongeBob look like the art on an Etch-a-Sketch. but I can tell from sudden squeals that Bob is on the move. out of the Green Room and in public view. "SpongeBob!" "Look. it's SpongeyBob!" "Over here. Bob!" "Where's Patrick?" 4:06 p.m. Fans are screaming for me! The only problem is that at the moment. I happen to be wedged into the doorway of the shack. "Duck your head." says Vest. "Come on. This is ridiculous. Twist sideways." She and her assistant give me a shove. and I am loose and stumbling into a crowd of what must be children. "Patrick! Patrick! Can I hold your flipper?" I am grasped by larger shapes. who must be teenagers or parents. I hear the raindrops plopping onto my hollow head. We get hustled toward the canopy and. surrounded by fans. I try to sway from side to side like SpongeBob. Dancing is impossible. Standing up and not looking desperate are my goals. 4:35 p.m. I feel like a Beatle. There are screams and bursting flashbulbs. At the height of my fame. inside an enormous knot of kids. my pantaloons get pulled. Two of my Velcro straps are loose. I try to hike things up. but it's difficult with flippers. I attempt the "help" sign I was taught -- a pantomime of snapping a pencil -- but there are too many bodies against me. crowded around. I am like an astronaut in space. My suit is leaking air. And the hour in here has changed: It's no longer sunset. It is tropical night. 4:50 p.m. I'm bending forward dizzily -- now I'm tipping. thanks to my giant head. I land temporarily on a padded knee. There are little noises of surprise: Patrick never does this on TV! SpongeBob is holding out his delicate hand. but I am going over. until I'm stopped by something firm but small. It is a hug. My head is being held by a little girl. She is hugging so hard I can't fall forward. I can't even move. "Goodbye. Patrick." she says. "I love you." I know the rules. I know I'm not allowed to talk. But I am Patrick the Starfish and it's clear what I must do. I reach out one flipper. then another. I hug back. "Goodbye." I hear Patrick say. "I love you. too."
travel,How to Find a Quiet Place to Relax in a Crowded Foreign City,Do you often come back from a trip and feel like you need a "vacation to recover from your vacation?" You're not alone. Many people feel this way because they didn't let themselves decompress at any time while they were away. Given the greater emotional and physical energy exerted during a trip. it's easy to feel drained or overstimulated during and after travel. Finding a tranquil place to relax and regroup during your trip is one of the most obvious ways to prevent mental or emotional burnout -- and keep every day of your vacation feeling (almost) like the first day you arrived. Unfortunately. traditional "quiet" places may turn into anything but if everyone else decides to go there for their own relaxation. Think of oceanside cafés that get so loud you can't hear the waves washing up; well-known churches that sound like malls inside; and parks that put you in the path of an impromptu tag game -- hardly anyone's idea of peace. Don't think you have to return to your hotel room mid-day. or wander into an isolated (and potentially dangerous) area in order to "get away from it all." Here are a few universal. but often overlooked. places to unwind. Botanical gardens. These can sound like a bore to those not interested in plants. but botanical gardens have all of the relaxing characteristics of parks. but because of the (usually) small entrance fee. attract a different crowd -- your chances of encountering skateboarding teenagers. drunks or soccer practice are slim to none. There is usually no shortage of places to sit down. and you can generally stay as long as you want after paying the day's admission. Universities. Many universities have the look and feel of self-sustaining villages. and you'd have a hard time finding one without some green areas and benches (and often a pond and some wildlife). Frat and sorority houses are less common outside North America. and while there's obviously going to be plenty of activity on the main thoroughfares on weekdays. the overall atmosphere -- especially on weekends -- is subdued. Another plus is that many universities are easily accessed within metropolitan areas. and even the grounds of most private universities are open to anyone. Zoos. You'd be hard pressed to find a zoo without an attractive. natural setting -- and interacting with (or just watching) animals can quickly pull you out of your head and back into the moment. About half of all major world cities have a zoo within three miles of tourist areas. Try visiting on a weekday evening. or mid-afternoon after school groups have cleared out. Embassy areas. These neighborhoods are particularly prominent in capital cities. and are often in easily accessible areas. Although there aren't many places to sit down. they are certainly a great place for a quiet stroll. Embassy neighborhoods are rarely crowded. aesthetically pleasing. and you can let your guard down because security is second to none. Stationed trains. Particularly in European cities. long-distance trains pull into a station well before departure -- by an hour. and sometimes more (especially if your city is the route terminus). A parked train can be a very peaceful alternative to trying to rest your mind and feet in the chaotic main station hallway. I've done it many times and not been bothered by attendants or conductors (unlike airplanes. which are usually swept and cleaned after every flight. the usual train is only serviced at the end of the day). Obviously. you need to make sure the train doesn't roll away taking you someplace you don't want to go. but the chances of this happening are minimal as you'll notice people start trickling in about ten minutes before departure. Off-hours and hideaways in hotels. After the maids have come through. and before the next round of guests check in. is an ideal time to get some peace in your hotel room. especially if it's anything but tranquil in the evening and early morning. The ideal time window is usually between noon and 3 p.m. If you've already checked out of a hotel. don't feel bad about relaxing in the lobby a few hours after giving up your key. It's unlikely that any hotel employee will ask you to leave just because you're done and paid for. After all. they want you to come back on your next trip. and write a nice online review about your stay. Finally. a surprising number of hotels -- particularly in Europe -- have rooftop terraces. These are often underutilized. because 1) guests aren't aware of them. or 2) they simply forget to head up there. The terrace can be a great escape when everyone else on your floor seems to be checking in. or coming in and out of their rooms. at the same time. An added benefit is that you get to see the city from a bird's-eye view. which can make it look less intimidating and give you a better perspective of where you are. Airport quiet spots. For some peace and space. many people know to head to the waiting area of a deserted gate. Less commonly sought. but equally quiet places include interdenominational chapels (many international airports have one. and you don't have to pray in order to use the room). and the lobbies of pre check-in areas. Most people automatically rush to the check-in counter and through security when they arrive at the airport. passing by many empty waiting areas adjacent to the airline ticket counters.
travel,The Sunken Town Of Halfeti. A Cittaslow Town In Turkey. Is Our Travel Tuesday,A member town of the international cittaslow movement. which was born in Italy in 1999. Halfeti is a little gem of a fishing town on the Firat River in southeastern Turkey. The movement. essentially. aims to improve quality of life in towns by being conscientious of health and quality of life of its citizens. the authenticity and local sourcing of food and having a rich cultural scene. Sounds good. right? Much of the town is submerged thanks to the Birecik Dam. which flooded in the 1990s. You can supposedly see the roofs of some sunken homes along the lake. Halfeti is famous for two things: black roses (which bloom dark red in spring and change to black during the summer months) and peanuts. YUM to both. Many of the 200.000 visitors a year arrive in spring and fall to do some hiking and head out on the water and do some water sports. There are 9 such towns in Turkey. meaning. yes. you can go see other examples of this "slow" living movement. After you see Halfeti. head over to Rumkale. to see the abandoned fortress there.
travel,America's Best Small Towns. According To Rand McNally,We love our small towns. from the art and culture. the sense of community to the food. There are so many great small towns; each with a special quality to them. so how do we know which one is the best? Rand McNally seems to have identified them in their third annual contest. Starting with 1.200 towns (population size of 150.000 and under). users voted for the best small town in six different categories. Judges then selected their top 30 finalists. who gave in video and writing submissions. The winners were then determined based on the number of votes. overall fit. social media participation. and video and written submissions. The winners this year: Most beautiful: Jefferson City. MO Most fun: Corning. NY Friendliest: Kewanee. IL Most patriotic: Gallup. NM Best for food: San Mateo. CA Best for Geocaching: Helena. MT Are any of these small towns on your next road trip list?
travel,7 Havana Attractions You Can't Wait to See,These incredible experiences are now closer than ever. The U.S. government announced new rules on January 15 that will significantly liberalize travel and trade between the U.S. and Cuba. Orbitz hopes to be able to start selling flights and hotels to Cuba sometime in 2015. as Orbitz CEO Barney Harford discussed on CNBC this morning. But. in the meantime. let's take a look at some of Havana's top attractions. which now seem closer than ever. 1. Speed through the narrow streets in a 1950s American car. In Havana. these vintage beauties are everywhere. And you can ride in one. Many serve as shared taxis. so just flag one down and tell them where you're headed. If it's a match. start negotiating your price. 2. Shake your rumba at Callejon Hamel. The bold. colorful art installations towering over this charming alleyway make it worth a visit any day of the week. But be sure to go on a Sunday to catch La rumba de Cayo Hueso. a big rumba dance party with a live band that brings everyone to the streets. 3. Fall in love with the crumbling splendor of Havana's colonial architecture. A classic scene: Laundry flaps on a line on the balcony of a once-opulent. now-crumbling paint chipped apartment building. Mosaic floors and walls. and stained glass abound. You'll also want to explore Havana's many historic plazas. cathedrals and fortresses. many of which date back about 250 years. 4. Get some novel ideas at Ernest Hemingway's Finca Vigia. The Cuban government took over Hemingway's estate just outside Havana when the American author died in 1961. And it seems they haven't changed a thing. Magazines from that year still stack the rack in the living room. and the closets are still filled with Papa's shoes and other everyday accoutrements. The stately home -- excellently decorated -- is where Hemingway wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. Be sure to stop for a Hemingway cocktail with fresh sugar cane at the pop-up bar located on the grounds. 5. Soak up some sun at Tropicoco Beach. A 15-minute cab ride takes you just outside of Havana to this idyllic beach that attracts locals and tourists alike. Flag down one of the roaming vendors for a refreshing rum-coconut water combo sipped right out of the coconut. 6. Bask in glitter and lights at the world-famous Tropicana Club. Soak up some charming vintage entertainment at what's arguably the world's most famous cabaret. Not much has changed here since the club opened in 1939. so expect to be dazzled by flashy musical numbers. sparkly bikinis and wild carnival headdresses. 7. Enter the magical land of Fusterlandia. Imagine a magical place -- not Disney -- where every surface is covered in colorful mosaics. where you can explore soaring sculptures. statues and arches that wind up. over and around what the artist calls his home. studio and "wild kingdom." Fusterlandia's creator. artist Jose Fuster. has also taken his creative touch outside the walls of his creative complex. covering many of the town's surfaces in his trademark mosaics.
travel,Top 5 Things to Do in Philly With Kids,As the mother of two boys. it was only fitting to plan a trip to the City of Brotherly Love. Although enthusiastic renditions of "Yo. Adrian" would elicit blank stares ('Rocky who?') and they're too young to appreciate a gooey Philly cheese steak. Philadelphia is ideal for a weekend getaway and combines good old fashioned fun. child friendly attractions plus a big dose of history. Its small size and compact city center means you can cover a lot of ground -- quickly. Here's my take on the top 5 things to do in Philly with kids. 1. The Hotel Monaco Where you stay sets the tone for any trip. and we chose the new Hotel Monaco in the Old City. The décor is fun. stylish and colorful. Although our room wasn't enormous. it packed a punch with bold patterns on the floor and walls. There are also little design surprises. such as the closet interior. wallpapered in fashionable quotes from the likes of Coco Chanel. Marilyn Monroe and Bill Blass. The kids loved the vast candy selection in our room (hello. M&Ms) and were delighted by a complimentary goldfish that stayed in our room. I was happy I didn't have to feed it or change the water. The location couldn't be better for sight-seeing; it is right across the street from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. Complimentary tea. coffee and cider donut holes in the morning kept everyone happy but if you need something more substantial. the in-house Red Owl tavern serves everything from huevos rancheros to chipotle meatballs. There's also a children's menu. 2. Please Touch Museum You know how most museums are covered in signs saying "don't touch." and you might have experienced heart palpitations if your child (like mine) tried to touch priceless ancient Greek sculptures from say. oh. London's Victoria & Albert museum? To avoid premature cardiac arrest. take them to the Please Touch Museum. Located just outside the city center. everything here is hands on and fun and meant to be touched. The museum is divided into themed zones. from City Capers. Flight Fantasy. River Adventures and Wonderland where they can do everything from dress up like an astronaut to drive a bus or conduct science experiments. Good luck extracting your children from here. 3. The Insectarium Are you ready to be grossed out? This museum showcases thousands of insects in all their beautiful and creepy delight and is guaranteed to be a hit with non-squeamish kids. The Insectarium has both live and mounted examples. ranging from tarantulas and assassin bugs to scorpions and metallic beetles. There's also a movie theater and hands-on activities like a spider web. Saturdays at 11am is bug feeding time. 4. Independence National Historic Park The site of Independence Hall. the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence. as well as the Constitution. is a must-see. Admission is free although tickets are required. and try to get there early to beat the lines. Tours of Independence Hall are conducted by National Park Rangers; if your kids are fidgety. download Junior Ranger sheets and activities from this website. The Liberty Bell. with its infamous crack. is housed in a minimalist glass and brick pavilion. Once you exit. don't miss the underground remains of The President's House. the home of the nation's chief executives before the capital moved to Washington. D.C. A series of glass panels lets visitors see the remains of the foundation. and video panels tell the stories of nine African-American slaves. 5. Benjamin Franklin Museum No other man is as closely associated with Philadelphia as Ben Franklin. a founding father who is as famous for his quips as scientific experiments. This museum recently re-opened after a two year renovation and is arranged thematically. Visitors will learn about his work as a diplomat. printer. scientist and statesman. Kids will appreciate the hands-on exhibits. In the "Ambitious & Rebellious" area. visitors can pick up a set of Franklin's own ink balls. which pounded ink onto newspaper. There also plenty of video installations.
travel,20 Unique Drinks From Around The World (PHOTOS),Even if you're not a big drinker. sampling a unique local beverage can be a fun way to spice up your travels and learn something about the culture at the same time. Often. these drinks are made with local ingredients you may not find elsewhere. giving your taste buds a special memory of a place -- as long as you don't go overboard. that is. After all. it does no good to learn about the culture through its alcohol if you can't remember what you learned the next day. Some of the drinks featured here aren't necessarily strange or exotic. but they're certainly representative of their location and -- in many cases -- will be unfamiliar enough to outsiders that it's good to have a bit of an introduction before you arrive. Food and drink are a major part of a destination. Different drinks are part of a country's fabric. their culture. their celebrations. even their religion. Even though many of these drinks may seem odd to you and I. they are all worth trying at least once (well. maybe not the toe one). In no particular order. here are 20 unique drinks from around the world that you may want to add to your list of things to try:
travel,Vibrancy in an Unknown Place,As you can see from my blogger profile. I'm writing from the heartland of America; the great State of Iowa. No. we're not the potato state. We're also different than Ohio. and -- contrary to popular belief. not all of us caravan to work on combines or tractors. Many know of Iowa as the curator of the political pulse. with our thriving Caucus' and "first in the nation" polling status. With the elections now at a close. we must find new ways to emerge into headlines. I recently had the honor of sitting in on a brand ambassador workshop put on by our Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau. This organization (known as the GDMCVB). has been working tirelessly for more than one year on a brand review for our community. The discovery process for the Greater Des Moines community brand involved engagement of focus groups. interviews with key business leaders. out-of-state organizational decision-makers. and many more. The cross-section took a pulse from a wide range of ages. demographics and interest levels. When someone mentions the Midwestern USA. what immediately comes to mind for you? Is it "welcoming". "friendly". "charming"... or noun of the like? Our findings uncovered an overuse of harsh nomenclatures which ultimately were providing our community -- and our State. a disservice. While one of our local grocer's tagline's truly is: "A Helpful Smile in Every Aisle" -- this is not what attracts folks from near and far to visit our hidden jewel. There is truth to the core messaging here. When you make the decision to travel abroad. or even domestically. I doubt that you predicate your travel destination to carve out only the cities that have "friendly" demeanor. or a "quaint and welcoming charm." You're looking for culture. vibrancy. action and history. To want to appease your palette with flavors and fusion. which you can't find in your own locale. Of those surveyed initially who did find an attraction to our Greater Des Moines community. the words vibe and artful energy. kept appearing. Were we missing something? Was there a cultural revolution taking place before our very eyes that we had not captured in our own community brand? As it turns out; yes. While Ashton Kutcher's brand-association through his notorious John Deere green ball-cap at least put us on the map and in the US!Weekly tabloid spread -- we longed for more. Between 2011 and 2012. Greater Des Moines received rave reviews from the likes of Forbes Magazine. Wine Spectator Magazine. and several of our community leaders found themselves on the "Top Business Leaders" national list. This was certainly nothing to balk at. but we needed to own it. Our centrally based community has truly evolved over the past several years -- and at a very rapid pace. So rapid. in fact. that we had not taken the time to catch up with our very own changes. We had not embraced them enough to understand how to market them. Data doesn't lie. and it was now our turn to creatively illustrate our value through our own vibrance. The former slogan for Greater Des Moines had been. "See Des Moines." which conveyed a window-shopping mentality. Any community who understands the creation of affinity through economic impact knows that you wish your target market to do much more than window-shop; you want them to open the door. walk in. and to explore. As of November 13. 2012. the Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau changed their tag to; "Catch Des Moines." Once I heard the news. I immediately thought of the many meanings of the word "catch" -- and how this new-found slogan could offer a chameleon-like appeal to visitors. guests and navigators. If you peruse the many meanings of "catch" within Wikipedia's Wiktionary. you'll find coverage abounding in an array -- and the use of catch as both a noun and a verb. Allowing the recipient of the message to interpret "catch" in their own way offers a certain mystique and wonder behind the phrase. It makes folks want to open the door -- as opposed to peering inside the window from the curb. "Catch Des Moines" gives our community a more vibrant voice. and to own what we have been crafting and coddling for all of these years. Through the diligence and hard work of many. our greater city has now earned the right to be "caught" -- rather than merely seen. Perhaps you will allow yourself to catch the Des Moines vibe. too.
travel,Attending The 2012 Paris Dîner En Blanc: Versailles. Notre Dame And Place des Vosges (PHOTOS),The Dîner en Blanc Paris is by now a fabled event. started 24 years ago when François Pasquier wished to have dinner with his friends upon returning to Paris after living abroad. So many wanted to come that he asked them to meet in the Bois du Boulogne and to dress in white so they could recognize each other. From there. the dinner became an annual flash-mob affair growing to as large as 14.000 attendees. always set in public with a backdrop of the most legendary Parisian monuments. The location is kept a secret until minutes before the dinner begins. This was my third year in attendance. and it never gets less exciting. While most thought that last year's Paris Dîner en Blanc. held simultaneously at the Cour Carée du Louvre and Notre Dame cathedral could not be beat. this year's events featured three dinners across two days. Two on Thursday at the Places des Vosges and Notre Dame. and one on Friday at the Orangerie at Chateau de Versailles. The latter. perhaps the most exclusive yet. was planned as a thank you to the organizers of the Dîner en Blanc over the years. Unlike the other Dîner en Blanc events that now take place in cities across the world which have a public signup process. invitations to the Paris dinner can still only be attained through old-fashioned connections. Still. exclusivity remains only one of the elements of the dinner. More than anything it is an evening about spontaneity and camaraderie amongst friends. about beauty and joie de vivre. Of all my years attending. this year's dinners marked a palpable shift into modernity: the younger generation had a stronger presence. live rock bands and DJs reflected an embrace of a new and different Dîner en Blanc. Tradition and decorum still reigned however. along with the tacit understanding that secrecy is the only way to maintain this event for future generations. And as always. there was a respect for the city that is Paris. for the architecture and spirit that enable such an event to take place and for the potential of the Dîner en Blanc to continually inspire more around the world to meet simply for the joy of being together. To read more about my past experiences at the Dîner en Blanc. check out my photographs on Untapped Cities from this year's events at Notre Dame. Versailles. last year's event at the Cour Carée du Louvre and the year prior in front of the I.M Pei Pyramid at the Louvre. Keep your eye out for an officially sanctioned documentary about Le Dîner en Blanc Paris which I had the fortune to be a part of as they followed my preparations for the dinner. I hope to see you at one of the upcoming Dîner en Blanc events around the world!
travel,Inside the Fringe Private Olympics Club,The Games are a few weeks in. and you've finally caught Olympic fever. Whether you've scored last-minute tickets on London2012.com or are simply glued to the tube. there's no reason why you can't upgrade your game-watching experience to an elite level. How about a renovated Victorian warehouse to start? Set inside of a former furniture factory along the River Lea. The Fringe 2012 is a pop-up lounge located just outside Olympic Park. The newly gutted space has been given a makeover by muralist Ben Mosley and acclaimed street artist Ben Eine. who covered wall surfaces in vibrant. rhyming cockney slang as part of a curated "Great Stage" exhibition. But all eyes will likely be on the many enormous LCD screens in the beer garden area. on BMX. track and field. football. basketball. and all other remaining games. For membership passes beginning at £100. visitors can spend the day. get a meal and three drinks. and enjoy the open-air party atmosphere. If you have tickets to one of the final sessions. it's even better. The biggest selling point for pre-gaming at The Fringe in this reporter's opinion is its proximity to the Victoria Gate entrance. which is considerably less congested than Stratford Station's chaotic queues. This way you can spend more time enjoying your favorite athletes over a pint and fewer minutes shuffling behind 5.000 foreigners removing their belts at security. Game on.
travel,19 Reasons Why We're Pumped For Winter,As the true suckiness of daylight savings sets in. and our winter time blues slowly amps up. we wanted to take a second to remind ourselves that winter isn't all that bad. Snow is beautiful when it falls. it's totally normal to drink hot chocolate on a regular basis and visiting family (can be) really enjoyable. Herewith. some other reasons we're pumped for the loneliest season. 
travel,These Amazing Instagram Photos Of Finland Will Make You Appreciate Winter,We have decided that we want to spend our next vacation staring at the stars and taking in the snow in Finland. Yes. that's right. we actually want to spend some time in the snow. Once we saw Mikko Lagerstedt's Instagram photos of Finland. we were truly taken aback. The Finland-based photographer uses his home country as a breathtaking landscape that showcases the majestic beauty of nature -- especially in the winter. In fact. Lagerstedt appreciates the snow. "It gives the landscape a beautiful. different look and gives brightness to the short winter days we have here in Finland." he told HuffPost. For the picture below. titled "Purple Haze II." Lagerstedt merged two images together that were taken in the same location. One was taken just after sunset while the second was taken as he waited for the sky to be full of stars.
travel,How United Airlines is Making a Customer Service Comeback,Like a 747 loaded to capacity. United Airlines is rising — slowly. steadily and improbably. “I thought I was imagining it.” says Anne Klein. who works for a marketing agency in Durango. Colo. “But United is listening. It’s trying to improve.” Klein had two recent customer service experiences that gave her hope. The first. a handwritten thank-you card for her business. slipped to her by a flight attendant. And the second. a response to her request for a $68 refund after one of her flights had been canceled for mechanical reasons. Instead. United sent her more than she asked for: a $100 gift certificate. Many passengers had all but given up on the airline after a painful merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. United had managed to alienate customers ranging from frequent fliers like Klein to ordinary vacationers. thanks to significant cuts in its loyalty program and new policies that seemingly demanded fees for everything. Not surprisingly. its customer service scores were among the lowest in the industry. A new hope But. in September. United’s new chief executive. Oscar Munoz. said enough was enough. “Let’s be honest.” he declared in a videotaped message to customers. “The implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees. While it’s been improving recently. we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.” The changes have been small. but they’ve added up. In November. the airline eliminated an unpopular $50 processing fee for tickets refunded to passengers after unplanned events such as jury duty. illness or death. In December. it announced that. starting this month. it would serve a choice of snacks to economy class passengers at no additional charge. It also plans to eliminate another charge this month: a $25 fee for ticket receipts. All the while. United’s management has been asking its customer-facing employees to redouble their efforts to win back customers. And it’s focusing on its core performance. specifically its flight-completion numbers. or the number of scheduled flights actually flown. “Our customers want reliability from us.” says Sandra Pineau-Boddison. United’s vice president for customers. “It’s on-time performance. It’s a high completion factor.” United rising? During the busy Thanksgiving holiday week. United delivered an on-time performance in the 70th percentile. its highest level in three years. and a 100 percent completion rate. It was no fluke. United’s internal customer service numbers have been climbing steadily since Munoz made his promise: In November. it beat its 30.6-point customer satisfaction goal by two points; in October. it scored a 30.8. exceeding its goal by 1.3 points; and for September. it exceeded its 27.4-point goal by 4.3 points. United stresses that this is just the first stage of rehabilitating its image. a process that became more challenging after Munoz suffered a heart attack in the fall and temporarily stepped aside as chief executive. But it hopes it’s on the right track. “Oscar has given us a renewed focus.” says Pineau-Boddison. "Amazing" customer service So how is United’s initiative going over with its customers? Elizabeth Helsley. a frequent international traveler who works as a business consultant in San Diego. was stunned after one of her bags went missing on a recent flight from Paris to San Francisco by way of Newark. She wasn’t stunned because her bag had gone missing. but by what happened next. “After I arrived. I received a text message alert that one of my two bags did not make it and would be delivered to my address within 24 hours.” she says. “I also received an email where I could track my bag. see who was delivering it and at what time. At no time did I have to wait in line or on hold for them to rectify their mistake. They simply took care of it and kept me informed every step of the way. To me. that was amazing customer service.” The technology used to track and deliver those bags. part of United’s effort to upgrade its internal systems. is a key part of the airline’s new customer initiative. Last year. the airline introduced a service that allows customers to follow their luggage on the United smartphone app. “Before we had this. only our airport employees could see the luggage in the system.” says Pineau-Boddison. More improvements are planned. In early 2016. United expects to fine-tune its system to allow people with delayed luggage to specify their delivery preferences. To be sure. United still has a long odyssey ahead. It scored 60 out of a possible 100 points on last year’s authoritative American Customer Satisfaction Index. the lowest of any legacy airline and just a few points above discount carriers such as Frontier and Spirit. And it still has plenty of critics. including some of its own employees. who remain quietly skeptical. And the airline has a long way to go before some air travelers will come back. They’re passengers like Lex Page. an attorney from Portland. Ore.. who endured years of United’s indifferent attitude and mediocre service before he finally gave up on the airline. “Let’s just say that if United Airlines were to give me a free first-class ticket to anywhere they flew. I wouldn’t take it.” he says.
travel,India Is Home To The World's First Completely Solar-Powered Airport,One of the world’s three biggest polluters just took a big step toward reducing its greenhouse emissions and embracing renewable energy sources. India’s fourth-largest airport. the Cochin International Airport in the southern city of Kochi. announced on Tuesday that it is now “absolutely energy neutral.” The Economic Times reports. The airport is co-funded and operated by the Indian government through a public-private partnership. The airport’s energy neutrality is possible thanks to a 12-megawatt solar system consisting of more than 46.000 panels installed on a 50-acre site. The system can generate up to 60.000 units of electricity daily. According to Al Jazeera America. the project took six months to build and cost $10 million. which the airport anticipates it will recover within five years. The panels are expected to last 25 years. The panels were designed and installed by Bosch Ltd.. which has a five-year partnership with the airport. according to Catch News. The airport began testing solar energy in March 2013. when it installed a small solar plant on the arrival terminal’s rooftop. according to The Economic Times. The project has been seen as a model for the rest of India. and the government is urging other airports to follow suit. India's goal is to ramp up solar capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2022. Its current capacity is four gigawatts. India has a broader goal to derive 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2022. with 3 percent coming exclusively from solar. Earlier this summer. the government rolled out new incentives to encourage developers to turn to renewable energy.
travel,How Millennials Are Shaking Up American Work Culture From Their Parents’ Basements,Nearly one-third of U.S. millennials are still living under their parents’ roofs (and that’s a fact. not a snide remark). but that’s not stopping them from rocking the long-established boat of American work culture. The nine-to-five office gig is getting old. and remote work. apparently. is going to be its bold. new successor. Yes. they may be still getting grilled cheese sandwiches hand-delivered to them from mom as they hang out in the basement playing Grand Theft Auto V. but millennials are simultaneously managing to shift the foundational plates U.S. companies have found themselves firmly rooted on for the past two centuries and then some. Get ready for the big one. because it’s been a long time coming. and things are about to get all shook up. Aside from an active Tinder account and a healthy number of Twitter followers. there’s something else that millennials really want: freedom. Maybe it’s because Western civilization has long promoted the idea of “the individual” and everybody gets participation awards just for showing up. or maybe it’s not. but regardless of its origins. polls taken of millennials and recent postgraduates show strong leanings towards freedom and flexibility in the workplace — and perhaps most significantly. no workplace at all. Here are the numbers to prove it: 68% of millennials are more interested in a job that can be worked remotely (AfterCollege) 64% of millennials would like the opportunity to work from home (PwC) 82% of millennials say they would be more loyal to employers if they had flexibility (FlexJobs) From these three statistics alone. it becomes pretty clear that millennials are on board with a work culture that doesn’t take place in an office. It also becomes crystal clear that they’re willing to leave a job with no flexibility for one that offers it. Regardless of whether you want to accept it. the best and the brightest are always coming from the newest generations. That’s the deal with evolution. The other deal with evolution. is that majority rules. Because of this. employers had better start paying attention to the demands of millennials. because the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2030. 75% of the workforce will be made up of them. Of course. there are plenty of reasons for employers to want to go the route of remote hiring. from cutting back on opportunity costs to having more productive employees. but with the inevitable handover of the job market from Gen X and baby boomers to tech-savvy millennials. shifting to a remote business structure is proving to be a necessity for companies wanting to stay afloat. And if they don’t? Well. then some kid in his late 20s will just take the idea and start anew. Fortunately. it seems that businesses are catching on quickly. and despite IBM’s recent dismantling of their work-from-home policies. other big names in tech. health. and even travel have clearly gotten the memo and are running with it. Companies like Adobe. Mozilla. Grubhub. ZenDesk. and Cisco are just a handful of companies that are hiring remote workers. and thanks to the advancements of technology made over the past twenty-odd years. more and more are hopping on the bandwagon. As for the workforce. a whopping 43% of employed Americans were working remotely in 2016 according to a Gallup survey. and that number is projected to increase for 2017. Who knows. maybe the older generations are finally done pointing their fingers at “kids now of days” and shaking their hands instead. It seems that they’re on to something good. after all. (Maybe we should all move back into our parents basements).
travel,Why Pittsburgh Is A Hidden Travel Gem,Pittsburgh might not be on your list of 1.000 places to fly to before you die. but perhaps it should be. With a cultural scene that rivals that of many larger cities. and its proximity to an architectural icon and a moving historical site that everyone should see before they head for the great beyond. this city of rivers and bridges deserves a visit. Plus. of course. now that Southwest Airlines and JetBlue fly here. airfares to Pittsburgh are amazingly cheap. There's no place quite like Pittsburgh. an implausible and affable place of distinct and likeable neighborhoods. littered across a series of steep Southwestern Pennsylvania hills and secluded hollows. perched on cliffs and huddled down by its famed three rivers. Once at the forefront of the industrialized world. the still blue-collar city is shedding its old skin and growing into a new identity. as a knowledge center and a place of creativity. That's not to say that Pittsburgh's gone pretentious or anything. This is still the home of the Steelers and the Pirates. Hate sports? No matter: This is still a great place to kick back and knock back a few (local) beers. make some new friends maybe; it's a perfect city for slowing down and just enjoying life for a couple of days. We've got eight great reasons to visit Pittsburgh (or. rather. da Burgh) right now. Get in the Zone There are plenty of cool neighborhoods in town. perhaps none quite as nifty as Lawrenceville. Located not far from downtown. this industrial center along the Allegheny River that served as arsenal to the Union Army during the Civil War is now a magnet for young creatives. lured in by a charming vibe. The neighborhood is part of the city's 16:62 Design Zone. an area that features more than 100 home decor-related businesses catering to all tastes and budgets. While in the area. stop in at Dozen. the neighborhood bakery that's the rage around town right now. $10 Opera Tickets! One thing a lot of first-timers don't know about Pittsburgh is that while the city isn't as big as it used to be. it still retains a vibrant cultural scene from its heyday. From ballet to world-class art museums. a marvelous symphony and a healthy theater scene. Pittsburgh has just about everything you could want a city to have. arts-wise. while. for the most part. keeping everything super accessible. Curious newbies can take advantage of $10 main floor tickets to the Pittsburgh Opera. home-based at the historic (and breathtaking) Benedum Center. And let's not forget the accomplished Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Good Eats Pittsburgh has long been a town of simple tastes; for far too long. it seemed like the dining scene was content to hide out at least a couple of decades back from the present time. Recently. things have been changing. and rapidly; we're nuts for the ingredient-conscious. New American dinners at Eleven. the hardcore farm-to-table Legume Bistro in the North Oakland neighborhood* and the sleek look and feel -- not to mention the tasty American contemporary food and cocktails -- at the loungy Spoon in East Liberty. In short. you can eat really well here now. and not a moment too soon. It's Near Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and the Flight 93 Memorial Just an hour's drive or so from the city is one of the most iconic dwellings in the known Universe. the weekend home Wright designed for a wealthy Pittsburgh family. Some people come to PGH just as a jumping off point to visit. but of course there are many other great things to see and do here. (Tip: only the extended tour allows indoor photography. and it's well worth the $67 admission. although there are less expensive tours as well.) And speaking of nearby sites. the Flight 93 Memorial is also within driving distance. although the final phase is still under construction. It's a moving experience. Try the Coffee Pittsburgh is full of surprises; you probably didn't know it had a killer little café culture brewing. did you? From the locally-roasted liquid happiness at La Prima Espresso Bar (205 21st Street) to the sleek and sophisticated 21st Street Coffee down the block at #50 -- they use beans from Chicago's famous Intelligentsia -- to the cozy. sit down and stay awhile scene at Enrico's Tazza d'Oro in the heart of residential Highland Park (1125 N. Highland Ave.). coffee lovers are covered. Play the Market The city's Strip District is famous as the home of its wholesale markets. late-night gin joints and the obscene sandwiches at the terrific Primanti Brothers. but lately it's been showing signs of joining the 21st century. This fall saw the inauguration of the ambitious Pittsburgh Public Market. a Friday. Saturday and Sunday affair on Smallman Street between 16th and 17th Streets that showcases the region's bounty. A must-stop on any weekend visit. Hit the Mattress Pittsburgh is full of museums. some of them quite famous; if you visit just one. it should be the off-the-grid. awesomely unusual Mattress Factory. Tucked away in the back streets of the often-ignored North Side. artists have been creating installations in the space since the late 1970s. The museum offers a unique residency program. which allows the artists to live on site while dreaming up and then executing the installation or work of art. The museum is currently hosting an intriguing exhibit from the Lam Center of Contemporary Art in Havana. Cuba; the show deals with issues of race and racism in contemporary Cuban art. Square Off Speaking of mattresses. we're loving the sparkly. zen-like new Fairmont Hotel that's popped up right off Market Square in the heart of Pittsburgh's walkable downtown. A vast fitness center. a happening lobby bar and quiet. contemporary rooms. nearly all of them with great views (request one overlooking the skyline's crown jewel PPG Building). make this a great hotel just to waste a weekend in. never mind the city. We didn't try the restaurant. Habitat. on our two recent weekend visits but will next time.
travel,World's Most Romantic Hotels (PHOTOS),A good hotel. much like a good relationship. has that perfect alchemy of comfort and excitement. intrigue and indulgence. The trick is in finding your match. Fancy a heart-pounding hike followed by a hot mud bath? California's Calistoga Ranch may be your hotel soul mate. If frozen margaritas in a beachfront hammock are more your thing. we'd like to set you up with the Four Seasons Punta Mita in Mexico. Virginia's Inn at Little Washington. meanwhile. sets the mood nightly with its award-winning tasting menus and wine pairings. These are a few of the top-ranking hotels for romance. as chosen by Travel + Leisure readers in our annual World's Best Awards survey. No. 1 on the list: Big Sur's Post Ranch Inn. where rooms appear to float above the forest floor and alfresco hot pools seem to flow into the wild Pacific. Other hotels that seduced readers provide over-the-top pampering. At Tuscany's Castello di Casole. for instance. couples get massages in a former wine cellar and cozy up for classic films beneath the stars at an on-site amphitheater. Italy. not surprisingly. has a strong showing. as do Hawaii. California. and Mexico. with their irresistibly simple pleasures of sun. sand. and frozen drinks. Yet T+L readers also fell for hotels in some less-expected destinations like Tennessee -- where the rambling Blackberry Farm delivers candlelit barn dinners and breakfast in bed -- and Budapest. where you can channel Art Nouveau glamour at a gorgeously restored property on the Danube. And there's no need to commit to just one enchanting hotel. so go ahead and indulge your wanderlust this winter with your favorite travel companion. These hotels are heating things up.
travel,The 10 Best Scenery-Stealing Biker-Worthy Stretches Of US Route 6,In grad school. whenever I needed to clear my head. I'd get in my car and drive. It was. as most lovers of the open road will agree. a sensual experience; the voluptuous curves of certain byways. the undulating. gut-rousing. ribbons of asphalt. the smells of farms and cities. exhaust fumes and manure. These forays added texture to a life already consumed by exploration and travel; seeing vast swatches of the country at ground level allowed a certain intimacy that train and certainly air transport could never match. Thirty-five years later. I still prefer to get behind the wheel and see our country through the windshield. So far. in these posts and on my own blog www.stayonroute6.blogspot.com. I've covered many of my favorite places to stop along the 3.652 miles of Historic US Route 6 that spans the USA from Provincetown. MA to Long Beach. CA. But sometimes the drive itself is worthy of mention. Particular segments of the highway are spectacular attractions in and of themselves. For your driving pleasure. I present the ten best scenery-stealing stretches of US Route 6. 1. Route 6A from Provincetown. MA to Sandwich. MA on Cape Cod; 60 miles. Ocean and salt marsh views compete with charming cape-cod homes that double as antique and art galleries. Lush trees canopy the road. which at times crosses osprey nest studded inlets. This is a segment of Route 6 to savor. Drive slowly and soak in the bracing Atlantic Ocean air. 2. From Peekskill. NY to Harriman State Park over the Hudson River; 15 miles. Route 6 joins Route 202 as it follows the Eastern side of the Hudson River for a few miles. coiling and switch-backing up and down hills though rock cuts with river and Catskill Mountain views to your left. Locals call this the "Goat Trail" and it most likely was one before dynamite blasted out a wider path for cars. Route 6 crosses the Hudson River at the rustic and short Bear Mountain Bridge. The west side of the river is Harriman State Park - green park roads for nearly ten miles. Not one light. Not one store. Lovely. 3. Tuhkannock. PA to Wyalusing. PA; 25 Miles. This region of Pennsylvania known as the "Endless Mountains" is no hype. The mountain range does seem surreally endless; green and rolling. sculptural and shadowy. mostly following the course of the twisty Susquehanna River. It's quite a beautiful ride. But 25 miles west. in Wyalusing there's a change in the air. Distinctive drilling trucks and natural gas equipment start showing up in greater numbers on the road. The newly tapped Marcellus Shale is right beneath your tires here. 4. White Pole Road. Iowa; 26 miles. Iowa's first certified State Route and foundation for old Route 6. The White Pole Road (also known as The Great White Way). was part of the River To River Road. Flanked by whitewashed telephone poles the White Pole Road is now a 26-mile trip through the smallest of Iowa towns. Like most. they usually encompass only one downtown street that ends in a series of grain elevators. Though not blessed by natural beauty. these towns (Dexter. Stuart. Menlo. Casey. Adair) are rich in history. patriotism (see the Freedom Rock in Menlo). friendliness and excellent desserts (Menlo Café!). 5. McCook. NE to Wauneta. NE; 44 miles. Here. Route 6 is a fun-to-drive. windblown tar-streaked two-lane road. The landscape begins to swell. and the scenery is so stunning you might get lost in it. Grassy hills fold into each other like rumpled blankets. cows graze near brown streams - you are nearing Nebraska's Little Grand Canyon. which dispels the myth that Nebraska is boring flatland. 6. Clear Creek Canyon Rd. from Golden. CO to Idaho Springs. CO; 19 miles. This portion of US 6 is one of the most stunning stretches of the whole transcontinental highway. It's all about the scenery; the main attractions being rock. river and sky in ever unfolding manifestations. You may find yourself catching your breath at the wall of evergreens coming at you at 50MPH or at the white-water creek barreling alongside the car. It is truly overwhelming. geologically speaking. 7. Loveland Pass. CO; 22 miles. The switchbacks. hairpin turns and heart-stopping drop offs are all part of the fun as Route 6 winds up and over the Continental Divide in a 22-mile stretch called Loveland Pass. which bypasses the Eisenhower Tunnel down on I-70. The Tunnel prohibits tanker trucks from driving through. so those firetraps on wheels have to negotiate these hairpin turns and switchbacks along with you. The drive can feature pea-soup fog and icy precipitation. even in the middle of summer. 8. Gypsum. CO to Glenwood Springs. CO Through Glenwood Canyon; 24 miles. The word spellbinding falls way short in describing this portion of I-70/US Route 6. Craggy rock-faces. the Colorado River. and Union Pacific freight trains compete for your attention as you wend and twist through this muscular Rocky Mountain road - an engineering marvel of the first degree. In about 10 miles. the imposing Glenwood Canyon portion of I-70. completed less than 20 years ago. heaves into view. Part of the Glenwood Canyon roadway is cantilevered over the Colorado River. and follows its serpentine path like a 14-mile side-winding snake. If you're lucky. you'll see a long freight train hugging the canyon wall on the opposite side of the river; automobiles and train-cars mirroring each other in an almost impossibly graceful dance. 9. Helper. UT to Spanish Fork. UT; 60 miles. West on Route 6 out of Helper. the road constricts into a narrow canyon cut. It's an hour - 60 miles- to Spanish Fork with lots of truck and recreational traffic. and it is indeed a stunning drive; up and up to Soldier's Summit. elevation 7.477 ft. At the pinnacle. you'll see one gas station. snow-capped mountains and a prevalent elevation sign. Rolling down from the transcendent Spanish Fork Canyon into a vast valley. all of a sudden....it's Switzerland! Verdant hills surround you. a bit of a shock after all that sandstone and brown. brown. brown. 10. Delta. UT to Ely. NV; 151 miles. This part of US Route 6 runs through a succession of valleys and mountains (basins and ranges). On this relentless stretch of the highway. it can seem as if you're the only person on earth; that is until you see a pumpkin-orange garbage can near a gravel pullout. Up. around and down through the mountains - you can almost feel the volcanic energy responsible for much of the rock outcroppings here. Route 6 snakes around boulders and through chiseled road cuts; these are excellent spurts of driving. As soon as you crest the first hill. you'll view snowcapped mountains ahead. From this vantage point. it seems that the mountains go on to infinity.
travel,Exploring Bora Bora And Tikehau In French Polynesia (PHOTOS),If you are trekking to French Polynesia. it's almost a sin not to visit the most famous island to tourists. Bora Bora. This distinct island is synonymous with luxury. beauty and world class resorts. Everything in Bora Bora is on mini islands. even the airport. The only way to shuttle around from place to place is via water taxi. which tends to be very expensive. so plan on just enjoying your resort. as there is truly nothing else you need to do besides water based excursions that each hotel offers. The Hilton Bora Bora Nui Resort. most recently made more famous by the infamous Kardashian clan's visit. defines perfection in every sense of the word. Arriving to the floating hotel lobby is a magical experience as the hotel staff goes out of their way to make you feel like a celebrity. The resort is spread out over a very large natural island. unlike some other top resorts that opted to build on man-made islands. In Tahitian culture. man made islands don't possess the same spiritual embodiment that natural islands have. If visiting the Hilton. the over-the-water bungalows are a must as they are one of a kind. The Hilton also offers the only two-story over-water bungalows in French Polynesia. and they are without a doubt the show-stopping centerpiece in lodging on the islands. The ocean water in French Polynesia is crystal clear and has the most straight out of a Photoshopped spread from a magazine shades of blue that one could imagine. The thing is. until you are actually there. you wont believe or understand how water can be so beautiful and the water surrounding Bora Bora just steps it up a notch. Snorkeling. swimming with sharks. feeding sting rays and just lounging in the lagoon are all musts when there and can all be arranged by your resort. The Hilton even offers private feasts on their own private motu. If you are looking for over the top spa treatments. then both the Hilton and the Pearl Beach Resort Bora Bora offer some great options. The spa at the Pearl Resort is the pride of the resort. They offer every service and have more than enough space to facilitate many patrons at once. The spa itself is surrounded by ponds full of lily pads and makes you truly feel like you are on a different island within an island. Before leaving Bora Bora. check out the famous Bloody Mary's Restaurant which has been frequented and visited by every celebrity that has ever been on the island. It's a must do. selecting from their fresh and ever changing menu. If you are feeling adventurous and want to include and visit an island that is completely off the grid to the average traveler. then Tikehau is the place to go. Unlike Bora Bora. the island of Tikehau is cherished and considered to be the paradise of French Polynesia to Tahitians. This is because it is not a typical tourist destination and it's still considered untouched. Known for its pink sand beaches. it's a place to go to get away and disconnect from the world. The Pearl Beach Resort is the only hotel resort in Tikehau and although it's not as large or over the top as resorts on other islands. the staff provide a warm and welcoming environment as well as one of a kind lodging options. Apart from their over the water bungalows. their garden bungalows are extremely unique as they offer indoor/outdoor bathrooms. Coming to Tikehau is an adventure within itself as you land in what appears to be the world's smallest airport and you quickly feel a disconnect as there is only one hotel and it's a long boat trip away from the airport. For adventure seekers. take a quick boat trip over to bird island to visit a tiny island completely infested with several species of birds. It's both interesting and frightening. French Polynesia. with it's opening and inviting culture makes for a trip of a lifetime. The beauty one experiences while there are memories one will speak of for many years. From the amazing food. luxury resorts and overly friendly islanders. the islands make for a perfect backdrop for all visitors who want to get away to relax or who want to exchange vows to each other on perfect sand beaches. Information on islands of Tahiti and Moorea can be found in my previous post.
travel,The New Hotel Roblin is Paris Perfect,It's a cold winters day and I am craving a delicious bowl of the french onion soup just like the one we had in the wonderful cafe near the Church de Madeleine in Paris. It was our 27th wedding anniversary. We wanted to celebrate where it all began; we had a spectacular honeymoon and stayed at The Ritz Hotel in 1984. But that was then.
travel,Huizhou. China: Stuck Between The Old And New,To the northeast of Shenzhen in the Pearl River Delta lies the city of Huizhou. Unlike many of the other developed areas on the mainland north of Hong Kong. Huizhou has an ancient history stretching back to the Neolithic Age. Today. much of the new growth in Huizhou is from its various "Development Zones" that generally incubate export processing businesses and high-tech industry. The city's jurisdiction covers an urbanized section close to the border with Shenzhen as well as much of the surrounding countryside. Luofu Mountain and other attractions are largely responsible for Huizhou's reputation as an area of scenic beauty. Within the urban core. however. is Huizhou's South Lake and connected West Lake. Paddleboats can be rented to go out and explore the surface. which is crisscrossed by footbridges and roads. Around the lakes are paths lined with chairs and tables. From adjacent open-air bars and restaurants drink and food can be enjoyed while taking in the scenery. At night. green and yellow lights illuminate the lake's edge and bounce off its still surface. But if you visit this area after dark during the summer. don't forget to bring bug repellant. The mosquitoes around the water are fierce. Unlike nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Huizhou has a relaxed. almost country feel. Although it has an "Old Town" and remains of centuries old stone walls. its population and development have lagged behind its now-larger neighbors. It is on the edge of becoming a modern Chinese city. but for now exists somewhere between the old and the new -- a place where economic growth has not strangled the traditional feel. I hope that doesn't change. but I suspect it will. A bus from Shenzhen's main station to Huizhou takes about an hour. Get there before it's too late.

travel,A Girls Guide to Bonefishing,Ever since I read an article in Garden and Gun about a bonefishing trip that Yvon Chouinard and Tom Brokaw took. I was curious about the sport. Mostly because it takes place in my favorite place of all. the shallow. crystal-clear turquoise waters of the Caribbean. Then. a coworker told me about his dad's experience doing it and that it was "really hard." and I got "hooked" on the idea. I had to try it. Plus. it is fun to say "bonefishing." So on a recent spring break family trip to Harbour Island. Bahamas. I stopped in at the tourist office and picked up the card of a local guide and a brochure on how to bonefish environmentally correctly. Bonefish are slightly endangered. so it's strictly a catch-and-release sport. What I learned from Vincent. the guide who took us out. was that you wouldn't even want to eat a bonefish because...they have too many bones! Dangerous bones. is what I think he said. And thus. my 5-year-old and I set out on a bright sunny Saturday morning for a few hours of fishing. I decided to take Lucia for two reasons: 1) the mile-wide smile on her face as we sped across the "harbour" on a little boat from Eleuthera made me realize she's a boat-lover like I am (thankfully. she knows how to swim well in case she falls out). And 2) she likes to fish. For her 4 birthday. at her request. we went trout-fishing. Here are the basics: You start out in a tiny little boat (because for the fishing part. the boat is propelled by a pole) and go out in search of a conch for bait. Conch hang out in shallow. grassy waters pink side up. Vincent pulled a small one out with a kind of fork thing on a pole. Then you go around looking for signs of bonefish--usually holes in the sand where they dig for crabs or clouds of sand where they have just been digging. Fortunately. this happens to take you to amazingly beautiful deserted little coves that are perfect for a quick dip! Bonefishing can be done like fly-fishing (the challenging sort) or with a rod and reel (the kind for beginners). So we went to another cove to practice casting. where I proceeded to catch a bonefish...without bait!!!! Vincent was quite surprised. He cut up the conch for bait anyway (and he took the prime part. "scorched it." dipped it in the sea. and ate it raw!) Then we did a bit more fishing. and I let Lucia try her hand at it. She was good at casting but didn't catch anything. But by then it was getting hot and almost lunchtime. so we went back to the island with sunny grins on our faces. So. will I become an avowed Bonefisher woman? No. I realized that what I really want to do is poke around in a small boat and just look at stuff and swim and enjoy the incredible water without having to catch something. However. I also realized how important days like this are for little ones. Since my father passed away a long time ago and her other grandfather is 90 and barely able to get out of the house. the opportunity for her to have a surrogate grandfather like Vincent for a morning. and to be shown gently how to cast a rod and "jig it" (jigging is where you lightly pop the rod as you reel it in because you want the "fly" or the bait to look. in this case. like a crab hopping along the floor of the sea) is priceless. I confess it took me four days to get up the courage to call a stranger to take me bonefishing. But I was determined when I turned 50 that it was number one (for no special reason) on my list of things to try in my "next 50 years." And like so many things. the fear I had about doing it was just an indicator that I was about to do something totally cool and awesome. And the exhilaration of actually having accomplished it and enjoyed it was 10 times greater than the fear. I'm just saying.
travel,Tanzania's Geodesic Dome Suites Are The Ultimate Forest Escape,If you’re on the prowl for a romantic safari destination. look no further than Asilia Africa’s Highlands camp in Tanzania. Located in a mountain forest on the slopes of Olmoti volcano. the Highlands camp comprises eight futuristic dome suites. Each suite contains a king-sized bed. a luxurious bathroom with running hot water and flush toilets. and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Serengeti. Visitors can climb the Olmoti volcano or descend into the Ngorongoro Crater from camp. They can also drive through the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. which is home to leopards. buffalo. elephants and zebra. Best of all. the camp is eco-friendly. Highlands employs a full solar plant and collects rainwater off tents to minimize its ecological footprint. Geodesic domes are also more efficient than rectangular structures. because their spherical shape results in more even airflow. They also have less surface area. making them less susceptible to cold or heat exposure. This level of luxury does not come cheap: Asilia Africa charges anywhere from $430 to $895 per person. per night. Even if this is out of your price range. there’s no harm in checking out the merchandise! Take a look at Asilia Africa’s Highlands pod suites below.
travel,7 Travel Rules To Live By,Traveling the globe can teach you a thing or two (or seven). Apply these traveler's mantras to the ordinary life beyond your trip. and watch every day become a freeing vacation of its own. 1. Pack light. When traveling. you want your suitcase to be small so you'll have freedom to be active and explore. Same with your house-- clear it of all that excess clutter for a freer. more active mind. 2. Savor the moment. Travel is about enjoying this instant and not worrying about the problems that lie beyond it. Imagine what would happen if you did the same in your workplace or home. 3. Try new things. Trips are full of precious memories because they force you to do or see or try something you haven't before. Make similar memories in your hometown every day by braving an art class or making an ethnic dinner you've never tried. 4. Focus on those around you. On an open beach or in an airplane seat. you've got no choice but to engage in quality conversation with your sidekick. Take time every day to drop distractions and talk like you're the only two people in the world. 5. Don't stop dreaming. During those blissful moments of your vacation. you can't help but start planning the next one. Don't lose the momentum at home--make a pin board. start saving. and get your next vacation on the calendar. 6. Stay curious. At a foreign museum or on a historic walking tour. you're deeply interested in learning from other people... probably because you paid to be there with them. Bring that curious. open. willing nature to your relationships at home. 7. Smile big. Life is beautiful on vacation: you're on a break from the "real world" in a gorgeous place. and your amped-up attitude makes it feel like nothing on the planet could ruffle your happiness. Make that optimistic outlook part of your every-day demeanor.
entertainment,What To Expect From ‘Paddington 2.’ The Live-Action Kids Movie Adults Will Inevitably See,It can be hard to come by an animated film that entertains the masses. One that entrances not only children. but the parents who actually tote them to the theaters. “Paddington 2.” a rare bird (bear?). has a little something for everyone. Hitting theaters on Friday. the sequel to 2014′s smash “Paddington” thankfully cut ties with The Weinstein Co. (North American distribution rights were sold to Warner Bros.) to bring us another story about our favorite fictional bear. voiced by Ben Whishaw. This time around. a familiar enough plot awaits us: Paddington’s settling into his comfortable life at the Brown family’s house in Windsor Gardens. And with his Aunt Lucy’s birthday coming up. he’s lured back into Gruber’s Antique Shop to search for the perfect gift. It’s there that he finds an old pop-up book of London and sets his sights on earning the money to buy it. He takes up odd jobs as a barber’s assistant (this doesn’t go well) and a window washer (this goes better) to save up just enough to buy the book before it’s mysteriously stolen by a thief who knows the tome actually contains a map leading to secret treasure. That thief is washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan. played marvelously by Hugh Grant. who just nabbed a BAFTA nomination for his “Paddington” performance. The creators always had Grant in mind for the role. and somehow convinced him to join the cast by alluding to the similarities between the real-life actor and his fictional counterpart. “When Paul [King] and Simon [Franaby] were writing the script. they wanted to create the character of a vain. over-the-top. over-the-hill. completely past it. neurotic. has-been actor. And so they wrote. ‘Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant’ every time.” Hugh Bonneville. who plays Mr. Brown in the franchise. joked to HuffPost on Build Series Tuesday. “They said. ‘We’re thinking of offering it to Hugh Grant. what do you think?’ And I said. ‘Try him.’ And. um. he could take the joke.” he added. “Paddington 2” actually earned three BAFTA nominations. including Outstanding British Film and Adapted Screenplay. “People have been calling it the ‘Godfather: Part II’ of the family movie genre. which is praise indeed.” Bonneville said. “Not quite as violent. but it’s good to know that it’s been thought of as as good if not better than the first.” Bonneville. who’s better known in his role as Lord Grantham on “Downton Abbey.” credits the writer-director King for bringing the lovability of Paddington to life on the big screen. When the actor first signed on. he was fearful of what would become of Michael Bond’s literary bear. but with King’s vision. Bonneville said it all panned out pretty perfectly. “Paul King really is. without putting too fine a point on it. Paddington.” Bonneville insisted. “Quite a part from being short and round and furry. he’s also got this extraordinarily open heart and view of the world that is slightly eccentric. eternally lovable and has great wit. as well. That is one of the reasons both films have worked.” he continued. “It’s not just a kids film with a few gags for the tired grownups if they had to go along with their youngsters. It’s actually a film that does genuinely appeal across the generations. and that all comes from Paul’s spirit.” Having Britain’s most talented actors helps King’s cause. too. Alongside Bonneville appears the lovely Sally Hawkins. who’s having a banner year thanks to “The Shape of Water.” and the likes of Jim Broadbent. Julie Walters and Brendan Gleeson. all of “Harry Potter” fame. Gleeson plays hardened chef Knuckles McGinty. whom Paddington meets in jail after he himself is accused of stealing the pop-up book. But. let’s face it. even Paddington can warm the hearts of spine-chilling prison mates with his sweet-as-marmalade catchphrase. “If we’re kind and polite the world will be right.” “One of the simple little sayings Aunt Lucy has always taught Paddington is that if you look for the good in people. you will find it.” Bonneville said. “Some people involved in our penal system may say. ‘You’re not going to find it in our prisoners.’ but Paddington does indeed.”
entertainment,Kurt Cobain: Defended Against His Devotees?,The myth surrounding Kurt Cobain casts him as a songwriting genius. rising to international fame while simultaneously — but also problematically — unwaveringly devoted to punk-rock authenticity. He unwillingly and reluctantly became the voice of a generation. and he hated the rockstar fame and adulation that came with it. During the last couple years of his life. he was addicted to drugs. in part using them as a way to escape the pressures and perhaps even disappointments of stardom. Success. the myth has it. drove Kurt to depression and ultimately to suicide — the ultimate rejection of fame. The new HBO documentary. Montage of Heck. attempts to probe beyond the often-romantic hero worship of Cobain to get to the real Kurt. Director Brett Morgen was granted first-time access to a rich collection of Cobain’s personal materials. including hundreds of tapes. Maybe this film. then. will also tell us something new about Nirvana’s music. Artist documentaries tend not to focus on music-historical continuities and stylistic connections. and when they do. the observations are often simplistic. superficial or even incorrect. The worst in this regard tend to be the VH-1 Legends and Behind the Music episodes. but even the otherwise fantastic Beatles Anthology devotes proportionally little time to the band’s music. Artist documentaries often concentrate. instead. on the personal lives of their subjects. and in a certain sense. the more troubled those lives are. the better. Such films are most powerful when they highlight dramatic and titillating personal struggles and events. They are the least appealing. by contrast. when they spend a lot of time talking about the music in any detail. Music can certainly create celebrity. but then it turns out that celebrity is the more interesting thing to talk about. I strongly suspect that Kurt Cobain would have preferred us to concentrate on the music. along with the culture and historical contexts around it. That is what historians will ultimately do anyway. Fifty years from now. the sensational details of Kurt’s personal life will be a biographical footnote. while the band’s music will live on. For music historians. Cobain and Nirvana are mostly important for the group’s major-label debut. Nevermind. which rose to the top of the charts in early 1992. displacing Michael Jackson’s Dangerous for the number-one slot. and signaling a fundamental shift in pop music: The mainstream arrival of alternative rock. As interesting as the album is in itself. it is perhaps more significant for the commercial doors it opened for other alt-rock bands. acting much as the Beatles’ “I Want To Hold Your Hand” did to launch the British invasion almost 30 years earlier. The emphasis is often on how Nevermind disrupted and re-directed rock history. Viewed from a larger music-historical distance. Cobain’s music also seems more continuous with the music that preceded it than it did back in the mid 1990s. While Cobain himself was eager to point to influences from the punk scene from the late 1980s. his music also resonates with a wide range of even earlier artists. Kurt’s lyrics are filled with a kind of playfulness and fascination with wordplay that can be found in the lyrics of John Lennon (“I Dig A Pony.” “Mean Mr. Mustard”). Bob Dylan. and even Chuck Berry. Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers that all it took to get Kurt to double his vocals or add a harmony in the studio was to say. “John Lennon did it.” Kurt quickly obliged. His rebelliousness is reminiscent not only of the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. but also of Pete Townshend and the Who in the mid 60s. Kurt once wrote. “I hope I die before I turn into Pete Townshend.” a reference to the famous line in “My Generation.” And Kurt loved pop. at one point enthusing over the album. Get the Knack. while also having fun twisting the title of the hit single. “My Sharona.” A crucial and central element in the Nirvana story is how the band re-fashioned elements drawn form rock’s long history into a style that changed that history. Montage of Heck may help viewers see beyond the Cobain myth. That myth. however. has had enormous staying power. and partly because it resonates within rock history. Cobain’s early death is much like those of Jimi Hendrix. Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin (all died at 27). feeding the popular fascination with untimely demise. The element of depression reminds us of Marilyn Monroe or Brian Jones (and there are many more). Some have openly speculated that Cobain was clinically depressed. a condition that went back years before his drug addiction. and was almost completely undiagnosed and untreated during his lifetime. If so. it suggests that Cobain’s tragic death was not heroic in its rejection of a life of fame: What was heroic was that he held out so long against the darkness.
entertainment,‘Parenthood’ May Not Be Over After All,“Parenthood” creator Jason Katims wants to tug on your heartstrings a few more times. At the Television Critics Association panel for his new Hulu show. “The Path.” Katims revealed he’d be interested in returning to the world of “Parenthood” a few years down the line. citing Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” as inspiration: That would be a really interesting thing. to revisit ‘Parenthood’ when Drew [Miles Heizer] has now graduated from college and Haddie [Sarah Ramos] has graduated from college and somebody. who knows. may be nearing retirement age. Stuff that gives us fodder for new stuff and things we haven’t explored before. Seeing [Jabbar and the kids] growing up would be really interesting. Please. please. PLEASE let us see a teenage Sydney. “Parenthood” ended its six-season run on NBC last year with a flash-forward montage teasing the core cast members’ fates. That means if Katims does return to the series. viewers have at least a little bit of an idea of what they could possibly see. READ: more Jason Street Scott Porter.
entertainment,Here Are The Surprise Shows Coming To Netflix In May,Netflix announced its new shows a bit differently this month. Normally. Netflix releases a list of all the new shows and movies debuting in a coming month and sticks to that schedule. Occasionally. there’s an exception. like the surprise release of “The Cloverfield Paradox” in February. But these additions are rare. This month. the company has already unexpectedly announced four shows. As we’re only halfway through May. there’s there’s certainly a chance that there are more to come. The surprises have included the return of a few beloved shows. as well as an entirely new project. It remains unclear why Netflix decided to do this. though the company just announced its goal to have 1.000 original shows and movies by the end of 2018. So perhaps. given that strategy. the company realized it needed to start releasing even more shows per week than initially planned. Or maybe someone at the top just felt like trying something new. Netflix has so much power and money. the company can certainly take risks in tinkering with release rollouts. So what if Netflix botches a few promotional campaigns in the name of experimentation? It will apparently have hundreds more chances before the end of the year.
entertainment,Donald Trump Still Threatening Third-Party Bid,Donald Trump continued to threaten the Republican Party with an independent presidential bid on “Meet the Press” Sunday. The billionaire eccentric and Republican presidential front-runner answered a question from host Chuck Todd on whether he was flirting with a third-party bid again. “Well. it’s not a third-party bid.” Trump said. “Some people think. I can’t say that yet. Because I don’t see it.” What Trump doesn’t see. according to himself. is not winning the Republican presidential nomination. He stated that he’s leading in the polls nationally and in Iowa. New Hampshire and South Carolina. and so he doesn’t need to think about a third-party bid. If Trump were “mistreated” by the Republican Party. however. he says that he could still launch an independent bid. When asked whether he could foresee a situation where he lost the nomination and was treated fairly. Trump stated. “Yes. there is. And there’s also a way I could lose the nomination and feel that I was treated unfairly by the Republican Party.” Currently. though. Trump has no opinion on how the party is treating him. “Right now. I have no opinion.” he said. “I just know that I’m winning by a lot. I really have no opinion.”
entertainment,Disney acquires rights for future 'Indiana Jones' films,First Star Wars. now Indiana Jones? The Walt Disney Studios announced Friday that it has reached a marketing and distribution agreement with Paramount Pictures for future Indiana Jones films. meaning George Lucas’ two iconic franchises are now firmly in Disney’s hands. Of course. Disney has owned Indiana Jones production rights since 2012. when the studio acquired LucasFilm. Until now. though. Paramount possessed marketing and distribution rights. Those now belong to Disney. making the process of making and releasing future Indiana Jones films much easier — not to mention more likely. In return for the rights. Paramount will receive “financial participation on any future films.” In other words. the studio will still get an undisclosed cut of the business. Paramount will retain distribution rights for the first four films in the series. Disney did not reveal plans for any new Indiana Jones installments — and inside sources say not to expect any such announcements in the immediate future. Still. the move is a clear bid to start putting additional whip-cracking archaeology adventures into motion. The question now is whether Harrison Ford. 71. will still be the star. or if Disney plans on rebooting the franchise altogether. Commence your speculation now!
entertainment,Teaser For Tupac Shakur Biopic ‘All Eyez On Me’ Drops On Rapper’s Birthday,A teaser for the biopic of Tupac Shakur was posted to Instagram early Thursday on what would have been the legendary rapper’s 45th birthday. The “All Eyez On Me” preview includes scenes of an FBI raid and actor Demetrius Shipp Jr. appearing as Shakur before devoted fans. The clip gives Shakur followers further indication of how Shipp pulled off the portrayal after footage emerged in April of the actor recreating a famous courthouse interview that Shakur gave in 1994. The film has hit stumbling blocks on its way to the finish. going through two directors before Benny Boom took over the project. IMDB had listed Nov. 11 for the film’s release. but Morgan Creek Productions told The Huffington Post that the film has yet to secure a date.
entertainment,So Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez Did Ring In The New Year Together,While the rest of us are trying to stick to our resolutions. Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez threw the new year. new me approach out the window and celebrated in secret over the weekend. The on-again-off-again couple who are currently very much on again reportedly rang in 2018 together down south in Cabo San Lucas. where Gomez and friends were vacationing on a girls trip. “Justin flew in to Cabo on a private jet from Cancun where he spent a few days with his family.” a source told E! News. “He arrived on Saturday evening and checked into an oceanfront villa 10 minutes away from Selena’s villa where she was staying.” The two apparently watched the fireworks over the ocean together after Gomez and pals Raquelle Stevens. Courtney Barry. and Ashley Cook spent the day in the sun. Bieber also shared a photo over the weekend appearing shirtless (well. duh) in a Snapchat captioned “New Years” with a few friends. “Justin and Selena are doing great.” a People source added. Tweens and the pop culture inclined everywhere received the shock of their lives when the couple. who dated from 2011 to 2015 before calling it quits. seemingly rekindled their romance in November. After being spotted by paparazzi on multiple outings together. the two were photographed kissing after one of Bieber’s hockey games. confirming once and for all that heart truly does want what it wants. “I’m 25. I’m not 18. or 19. or 20.” Gomez said of her reconciliation with Bieber. “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before. it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean caring for someone ever goes away.” Gomez is still. however. on good terms with ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. who she dated right before she started to belieb again.

entertainment,Susan Sarandon Has Absolutely ‘Nothing Good To Say’ About Woody Allen,When it comes to Woody Allen. Susan Sarandon has “nothing good to say.” On Sunday. the actress addressed past accusations of sexual abuse against the director in a discussion with Geena Davis during Variety and Kering’s Women in Motion talk at the Cannes Film festival. “I think he sexually assaulted a child and I don’t think that’s right.” Sarandon said. “I have nothing good to say about him. I don’t want to go there.” Sarandon’s comments come just after Blake Lively. star of Allen’s latest film. “Café Society.” called the director “empowering to women.” “It’s amazing what Woody has written for women.” Lively told the Los Angeles Times. noting that the accusations against the director had no influence on her decision to work with him. “It’s very dangerous to factor in things you don’t know anything about. I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is he’s empowering to women.” she said. The controversy surrounding Allen’s past made the news again last week after his son. Ronan Farrow. published a piece in The Hollywood Reporter. Farrow criticized the media for ignoring allegations against the director and choosing not to ask him tough questions. Allen’s estranged daughter. Dylan Farrow. maintains he sexually assaulted her when she was a child. She went public with her story for the first time in a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times. No charges were ever pursued. and Allen has consistently denied the allegations. During the Cannes opening ceremony Wednesday. French comedian Laurent Lafitte also referenced Allen’s past by making a rape joke at the director’s expense. And while the joke offended Lively. Allen seemed unfazed. “I’m completely in favor of comedians making any jokes they want.” Allen said at a luncheon during the festival. “I am a nonjudgmental. non-censorship person on jokes. I’m a comic myself. and I feel they should be free to make whatever jokes they want.” “I’m never offended.” he added. “It would take a lot to offend me.”
entertainment,Theater: Bring It On Doesn’t; Into The Woods Loses Its Way,This is the show Lysistrata Jones hoped to be: a frothy high school musical that audiences embraced. Neither show is genuinely good. but at least Bring It On is painless in its anonymity. Plus. it can ignore brickbats since the show has just extended its “limited” run through January of 2013. It’s based on the 2000 hit film about high school cheerleaders that rather inexplicably spawned four direct to DVD sequels. This musical spin on the story is a mishmash of typical high school plots: our heroine Campbell (Taylor Louderman) yearns to lead her squad to another national championship. But redistricting forces her to switch schools in her senior year and head to the “scary” Jackson school filled with metal detectors and crews that dance at parties but think cheerleading is lame. Campbell must make new friends. whip stylish hip-hop dancers into savvy cheerleading professionals. win a national championship and oh my gosh. that Latino boy is really cute and I think he likes her! Anyone who has ever watched the national cheerleading competitions on ESPN knows those kids can wow an audience with their high flying stunts. Director and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler naturally draws upon those stunts to send dancers flying high into the air to juice up the audience and give a nice little spin to the typical Broadway moves. The all-star team behind the scenes includes Jeff Whitty of Avenue Q on the book. Tom Kitt of Next To Normal working on the music with Lin-Manuel Miranda of In The Heights. and Amanda Green working with Miranda on the lyrics. All pros. all with some great credits to their name and none of it remotely reflected in the by-the-numbers material here. In the spirit of cheerleading and emphasizing the positive. I’ll focus on moments and performances that worked. Miranda is probably responsible for the rare feat of bringing some modestly effective rap to Broadway — two solos by Nicolas Womack as Twig actually have a little verve and snap. Gregory Haney may have the awfully cliched role of the strong. no-nonsense transvestite but that doesn’t him from nailing his lines (and his dance moves) and actually delivering some genuine laughs thanks to his timing. (However. the final. lazy gay twist — just to titillate audiences — is tiresome even if it does give his character of La Cienega a kiss.) Similarly. Kate Rockwell makes the most of the one-note blonde Skylar. a self-absorbed competitor of Campbell’s. Neil Haskell is appropriately hunky as Campbell’s first boyfriend. though he’s given virtually nothing to do. Jason Gotay has a thin voice but a lot of presence that makes him appealing as Campbell’s new flame. I really disliked the written character of Bridget. the chubby kid with low self-esteem who blossoms at the new school. But Ryann Redmond certainly tackled it unabashedly. I really can’t praise Taylor Louderman. who left no impression as Campbell. but I certainly wouldn’t criticize her either. The role is too bland and filled with mushy inspirational tunes like “What I Was Born To Do” and “One Perfect Moment” to give anyone much of a chance. She certainly worked hard and smiled throughout. just like a good cheerleader But the real find is Adrienne Warren as Danielle. the leader of the dance crew at the new school who warily trusts Campbell. Warren has terrific presence and made her equally anonymous role a living. breathing character we immediately understood. believed in and cared about. All in all. the good casting of Rachel Hoffman and Telsey + Company are the main reason Bring It On isn’t the train wreck it might have been. I wasn’t wowed by the dance routines at the finale but they certainly incorporated what you’d expect. I thought Blankenbuehler’s most successful work was for “Friday Night Jackson.” The hip hop moves were fun. a few nifty touches (like having Jason Gotay as Randall “swipe” aside dancers to get a better look at Campbell) were clever and the sight of our heroine dancing around in a leprechaun suit (a bit of hazing on the part of Danielle) was funny and offbeat. Seeing Gotay get all romantic while staring lovingly at the leprechaun mascot felt like a brief. weird moment from a very different. far more original show.

But that doesn’t mean the attention is always welcome. Case in point: Khloe Kardashian. The 31-year-old member of the krew went on a mini Twitter rant Sunday calling the paps “f***ing disgusting“ and “scum.” after she says they cut her off while she was driving to a doctor’s appointment. If we were the paps. we wouldn’t want to get in Khloe’s way anytime soon. According to TMZ. the reality star contracted a staph infection. which may be why she was headed to the doctor’s office. The celebrity news site also claims Khloe may have contracted the infection at the hospital her estranged husband. Lamar Odom. was staying in last month. Last week. the Strong Looks Better Naked author was forced to cancel one of her book signings due to an illness. which she said was stress-related. She made sure to apologize to her fans via Twitter: 
entertainment,HBO: 'Game of Thrones' piracy is a compliment,How does HBO feel about having the most pirated show on TV? Not too bad. apparently. HBO programming president Michael Lombardo spoke to EW about the rampant illegal downloading of the network’s fantasy hit drama Game of Thrones. which returns for its third season tonight. The show’s second season was recently released to record-setting DVD sales for the network. But in December. Thrones topped another chart that is far more dubious — Thrones ranked as the most illegally downloaded TV series for 2012. “I probably shouldn’t be saying this. but it is a compliment of sorts.” Lombardo said. “The demand is there. And it certainly didn’t negatively impact the DVD sales. [Piracy is] something that comes along with having a wildly successful show on a subscription network.” The show is currently. on a per-season basis. the network’s top money-earner despite widespread piracy of the show. the executive confirmed. “If you look at aggregate of international and DVD sales — which are the two revenue streams we look at since we’re not selling it domestically on another platform — yes. absolutely. in terms of shows we have on now.” Lombardo said. In fact. one of Lombardo’s issues with piracy is a creative one. The executive expressed concern that illegal copies can be of poor quality when the Thrones team takes pride in lavishly producing the show. “One of my worries is about the copies [downloaders are] seeing.” Lombardo said. “The production values of this show are so incredible. So I’m hoping that in the purloined different generation of cuts that the show is holding up.” Still. Lombardo noted that HBO’s policy remains firmly anti-piracy — “We obviously are a subscription service so as a general proposition so we try to stop piracy when we see it happen. particularly on a systematic basis when people are selling pirated versions.” he said. But he also added. perhaps referring to casual individual-user downloading. “No. we haven’t sent out the Game of Thrones police.” According to one estimate. Thrones‘ second season finale was illegally downloaded 4.3 million times worldwide last year. That’s quite a large number considering the show averages around 10 million viewers across all HBO platforms. Heavy Thrones piracy is likely due to several factors. such as the popularity of the show among young men (the show skews 58 percent male and the average fan is 41 years old) and HBO’s current digital distribution strategy. Though HBO subscribers can watch Thrones online via the network’s HBO GO service. you can only subscribe to HBO in the first place through a traditional cable or satellite provider and many younger TV fans are opting to “cut the cord.” A top HBO executive recently hinted that the network is contemplating a digital-only subscription option. a move that would likely reduce the amount of piracy of its shows.
entertainment,This Keanu Reeves-Adam Driver ‘Face Swap’ May Be Just A Jedi Mind Trick,Some folks online have long believed that actors Keanu Reeves and Adam Driver could be one and the same. But comic book creator Mark Millar took the lighthearted theory to the next level when he shared what he claimed was a face swap of the two stars on Twitter Monday. Millar’s purported shot of “John Wick” star Reeves on Driver’s body (which actually emerged online earlier in the year). leaves you “confused and slightly lost.” he said. (One might note that there is only the one photo of Driver’s body. and no corresponding body for Driver to “swap” to). But it was certainly confusing to us and some Twitter users: For comparison. here are actual photographs of the pair:

Warrior director Gavin O’Connor has since taken over. and they’ve continued shooting what they can with Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton. End Of Watch’s Michael Pena has signed on to join David O.

entertainment,Donald Trump ‘Has Never Been A Fan’ Of The Huffington Post,Business mogul Donald Trump responded Friday to The Huffington Post’s announcement that coverage of his presidential “campaign” will be part of our Entertainment section by saying he’s “never been a fan” of the site. In a statement Friday. Trump said he is “number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll.” referencing HuffPost Pollster. which averages over 100 public polls on the presidential race and compiles the results in one place: Trump continued to criticize The Huffington Post on Saturday. With the first primaries still months away. polls have limited value in predicting how much of the vote any one candidate will ultimately win. At this point during the 2012 election. we hadn’t even reached the brief surges seen by Rick Perry. Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich — all of whom did better at one point than Trump is faring now. This year. the GOP field is even more divided. and with so few voters paying attention. Trump’s current strength speaks mostly to the chaos of the primary and the tidal wave of coverage his candidacy has received. Polls this early in the presidential race should also be taken with a dose of skepticism because many candidates — including Trump — experience a post-announcement bump in the polls. Trump. whose shit-talking game is so bad it’s good. criticized “the money-losing Huffington Post.” calling it a “glorified blog” despite having shared our content in the past: “The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source.” Trump’s statement said. “Mr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog. He is focused on Making America Great Again.” HuffPost announced Friday that coverage of Trump would no longer treat him as a legitimate presidential candidate. “After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president. we have decided we won’t report on Trump’s campaign as part of The Huffington Post’s political coverage.” HuffPost Editorial Director Danny Shea and Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim wrote. “Instead. we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section. Our reason is simple: Trump’s campaign is a sideshow. We won’t take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say. you’ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.”

Cyrus opens up about why she hates red carpets and what she’s looking forward to telling her contestants on “The Voice.” “[A year ago] I had to do the [’A Very Murray Christmas’] premiere. and I will never do a red carpet again.” Cyrus said. “Why. when people are starving. am I on a carpet that’s red? Because I’m ‘important’? Because I’m ‘famous’? That’s not how I roll. It’s like a skit—it’s like ‘Zoolander.’” Instead. the singer (who doesn’t have a publicist anymore) says she keeps fans up to date with her Instagram feed. There. she publishes photos about her work with her Happy Hippie Foundation. cute pics of boyfriend Liam Hemsworth and stuff about her new coaching gig on “The Voice.” As far as advice-giving goes on the NBC show. Cyrus says she wants her contestants to stand out. much like a famous senator from Vermont. “I don’t want this to come off the wrong way. but I’m going to tell my contestants: Be Bernie Sanders.” the singer told Elle. “Be the person people want and love. Don’t worry about the masses. That’s how you make a memorable moment. Let people talk about it.”

I kind of boot him out.” She continued: “Like if he stiffens. then I know. ‘Hmm. someone’s dead.’” It seems like Leslie picked up a bit of Ygritte’s fiery personality.

entertainment,R. Kelly Confirms He’s Not Performing At Inauguration With Odd Photo,Looks like R. Kelly was pissed. The R&B singer responsible for classics like the “I Believe I Can Fly.” “Ignition (Remix)” and the rap opera “Trapped in the Closet” recently found himself embroiled in a debate over whether or not he’d be performing at President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Rumors started swirling on Tuesday evening. when a comedian tweeted that Kelly would be performing. Nipping that in the bud. Kelly responded to the rumors with the following tweet on Thursday evening: If it’s unclear as to why all of this is. well. fascinating. let’s break it down. Earlier this week. BuzzFeed published an unverified intelligence report indicating Russia has compromising information on Trump. Part of that information included allegations that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a hotel bed that the Obamas once slept in. This reported information then launched a social media storm involving jokes about “golden showers” and calling Trump “PEEOTUS.” The president-elect. for his part. seemed to respond to the allegations by calling it “FAKE NEWS” on Twitter. How does this tie to R. Kelly? Kelly has faced serious sexual assault allegations in the past. some specifically involving urination. (Kelly has maintained his innocence throughout and was never charged with statutory rape. but has settled civil lawsuits that detailed as such in the past.) Back in 2002. a video leaked that allegedly showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl and subsequently urinating on her. The allegations became more widely known after a comedy sketch by Dave Chappelle called “Piss on You.” So. for those playing at home: Trump’s alleged activity + His need for an inauguration performer = Rumors of R. Kelly making an appearance Kelly didn’t help assuage the rumors with his tweet. either. Notably because the background is yellow (of all the colors!) and the words printed in red form this head-scratcher of a phrase: “rumors online not untrue.” In any case. Twitter has been true to form about the whole thing. providing entertaining gems like this:

On a positive tip (I want to try using that phrase to see if I can bring it back). Michael Keaton made a comeback. U2 released one of their best albums in decades (don’t hate). and Chris Pratt became a movie star. On a downside. we lost way too many talented people this year from Robin Williams to Joan Rivers to Philip Seymour Hoffman. In a word. it sucks. It will always suck. Williams’ death in particular will always hurt because of all the good he brought to us all. Anyway. as we close another year. here are my personal favorite moments in pop - music. TV. and film. Arts aside. let’s all appreciate what we have more in the new year. love each other more. and hurt each other less. Live love. Love life. Now for something totally less important than the words I just uttered...
entertainment,This Theory Perfectly Explains Why ‘The Hobbit’ Movies Were So Bad,Look. some of us liked “The Hobbit“ trilogy. They’re not the perfect movies. but it’s a perfect adventure. Oh. and there’s a dragon who’s a total baller. Other people. however. didn’t really appreciate the films. In fact. they really hated them. And that’s how frenemies are made. The criticism has been that the movies were overly exaggerated. there was too much CGI and it didn’t need to be stretched into a trilogy. Now. a fan theory suggests the films were actually meant to be a little ridiculous and needlessly drawn out. The Theory: “The Hobbit” films were bloated with CGI and long-winded because they represent Bilbo’s own exaggerated retellings of his adventure. Redditor Questionbdp posed the idea as “internal justification” for why the movies were a “disappointment.” and it actually makes sense. The Redditor explains: What Bilbo actually experienced during his adventure with the Dwarves was probably far less significant and monumental than the movies make it out to be. because the movies show how Bilbo retells his adventures. not how he actually lived them. The theory goes on to say Bilbo probably felt bummed after he returned from his adventure to find all the other Hobbits didn’t care and were selling off all his stuff. (You nasty Hobbitses!) Because of this. he makes his story larger than life and “events which only filled a small book turned into three separate movies.” Commenters called the theory “brilliant.” and one even joked. “Lol. Peter Jackson. is that you?” Speaking of Jackson. even he says “The Hobbit“ movies were meant to be a different tone than “Lord of the Rings.” but could this be the reason why? In J. R. R. Tolkien‘s original stories. Bilbo authors his own memoir. There and Back Again. so it’s entirely possible that he embellished a bit. The dude was pretty good at making stuff up when explaining how he escaped the Goblin tunnels to his Dwarf bros. after all. And how else would you explain Legolas running up a crumbling tower? Ugh ... #SMH. Jackson said he doesn’t have regrets when it comes to the films. so we’re thinking he either completely missed that Legolas scene. or perhaps there’s a bigger plan at work. Please let there be a bigger plan at work.

entertainment,Amy Schumer Is Overexposed But Doesn’t Care In New ‘Inside Amy Schumer’ Trailer,A few things have changed since “Inside Amy Schumer” was last on the air. The titular comedian became something of an “it girl.” released her film “Trainwreck” to critical and commercial acclaim. took a dive on the red carpet in front of Kim and Kanye and jet skied with Jennifer Lawrence. Seriously. we’ve seen a lot of Amy Schumer in the past year. And after watching the new trailer for Season 4 of “Inside Amy Schumer.” we’re pretty sure she would agree. “Amy. the test came back positive.” a doctor tells Schumer in the promo set in a clinical exam room. “I’m sorry to tell you this. but you’ve been overexposed …Yes. you’re everywhere. magazines. this Instagram photo of you on the subway wearing a poncho. Amy.” He urges her to stay out of the public eye. That means no magazine covers. no late-night talk shows. no podcasts (“Thank god.” she says) and most especially no more of that basic cable show that made her famous. “No can do. doc. Gotta follow my heart. Keep exposing my self.” she says. breaking the fourth wall with a wink to the audience. Hopefully Schumer’s newfound celebrity means that the new season will be full of famous guests. Just try to top this. Lawrence. 
entertainment,‘Game Of Thrones’ Actor Writes Bittersweet Tribute Song For His Character,Last week’s “Game Of Thrones” episode. “The Door.” pushed a Valyrian steel dagger through the hearts of fans when Hodor met his end at the claws of the wights. That final scene played out in two places: The present. where Hodor holds the door against an army of the dead as Bran and Meera try to escape. and the past. where Bran seems to warg into a young Hodor. then known as Willis. Being kind of the worst. Bran unwittingly links Hodor’s mind through time and alters it beyond repair. As Hodor hears Meera shouting “hold the door” in the present. so does young Willis. repeating the phrase until it devolves into “hodor” — the only word he would be able to say from that point on. Hodor’s origin and death scene will go down as some of the most tragic moments in the whole series. Now. they’ve been memorialized in song. Sam Coleman. the 19-year-old actor who plays young Hodor. wrote and recorded a piano ballad in honor of his character. appropriately titled “Hold The Door.” It’s fantastic. But it also might help clear some things up. The episode didn’t make clear what. exactly. was going through Hodor’s mind at the time of Bran and Meera’s escape. However. Coleman’s lyrics paint a vivid picture of an innocent young man learning his role in a war that wouldn’t play out until years later. He sings: Then I was on fire I only had just one desire I would follow you until the end of time Put my life right on the line Making sure you wouldn’t die But there was one condition I only had one mission A simple one I knew I had to face When I reached the time and place I’ll hold the door. I’ll hold the door. I’ll hold the door For you. for you. According to Coleman — who would know better than most — young Willis saw it as his mission in life to protect Bran when Bran appeared in the courtyard at Winterfell. accepting his fate instead of trying to avoid a terrible death. Tears.

Things are different now. and I know a lot of the work that paved the way for women happened before I was around [...] I was never that feminist girl demanding equality. but maybe that’s because I’ve never really faced inequality.” Cuoco later clarified her comments in an apology on Instagram. “In my Redbook article. some people have taken offense to my comments regarding feminism — if any of you are in the ‘biz’ you are well aware of how words can be taken out of context.” she wrote. “I’m completely blessed and grateful that strong women have paved the way for my success along with many others. I apologize if anyone was offended. Anyone that truly knows me. knows my heart and knows what I meant.” Speaking to Entertainment Tonight following the Instagram apology.

entertainment,Jason Derulo Accuses American Airlines Of ‘Racial Discrimination’ After Luggage Dispute,Jason Derulo is accusing American Airlines of “racial discrimination” after an alleged disagreement about luggage took place at Miami International Airport. The singer expressed his dissatisfaction with the treatment he reportedly received by police and AA staff members. “I spent millions on your airline throughout the past ten years between myself and my entire staff but have still experienced racial discrimination today at miami airport!!!” he wrote in the caption of an Instagram post. The pop and R&B star claims multiple AA employees cursed at him and his team. who were all flying from Miami to Los Angeles on Wednesday. according to People. Apparently. there was a dispute over the group’s luggage ― they wanted to check 19 bags. but. an airline source told the magazine. even the most elite members only get three free checked bags. One member of the crew took on the responsibility of checking the bags. and claimed AA was going to charge the group an extra $4.000 to do so. Derulo explained to People. According to Derulo. he and his crew have never had an issue checking that many bags free of charge “because of our status ― with all of our miles ― so we’ve never paid for bags.” he told People. “So. $4.000 is obviously a huge sum.” he added. “We were like. ‘No. we’re not paying that. We’ve got to turn the plane around.’” In a statement obtained by People. AA said the plane “returned to the gate prior to departure. A passenger elected to deplane in order to travel with their checked bags. The passenger has been rebooked with his checked bags on a later flight this evening.” Derulo claimed that the captain of the flight began cursing at the singer and his team as they were leaving the plane. The singer told people the alleged incident made him feel like the captain “was trying to make it seem like we were delinquents.” Derulo said that once the group got off the plane. they were met by 15 police officers as well as an airline staff member who reportedly began cursing at them. The singer said he decided to live-stream the events. “So I go live. and I start to hear whispers happening. and as soon as they find out who I am. everything changes.” Derulo told People. “Every single person becomes somebody else. and all of a sudden. we’re not in trouble anymore.” In his Instagram post. Derulo suggests that if he were not a celebrity. he would have been arrested. The Miami-Dade PD filed a police report about the incident. which contradicts Derulo’s account of the events. In the report. an airline employee said the singer and his crew “smelled of marijuana and were getting aggressive” while checking in. The group was also reportedly being uncooperative when they initially got off the plane. The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for Derulo for further comment and will update this post accordingly.

entertainment,‘Last Jedi’ Director Explains How He Hid A Classic ‘Star Wars’ Easter Egg,Following the release of “The Last Jedi.” some fans had a bad feeling the movie was missing one iconic staple. But director Rian Johnson is here to set the record straight. Fans feared that the new “Star Wars” movie had omitted a classic line that’s been uttered throughout the franchise ― some variation of the phrase “I have a bad feeling about this.” Luke (Mark Hamill) says it in “A New Hope.” Leia (Carrie Fisher) says it in “The Empire Strikes Back.” Han (Harrison Ford) says it in “Return of the Jedi.” and so on. You can watch the different instances in the compilation below: At first. it seemed like the line didn’t make it into “The Last Jedi.” and die-hard “Star Wars” fans took notice. However. in response to tweets from his very concerned audience. the director confirmed that the phrase did. in fact. make an appearance in the movie. And now we know when. In an interview Friday. HuffPost asked Johnson if the line came from BB-8′s anxious beeps when the droid and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are flying into battle against the First Order near the start of the movie. The director confirmed: Yes. that was it. “Yes!” he said with a laugh. “Good catch!” In 2016. “The Force Awakens” sound supervisor Matthew Wood broke down BB-8′s language and sounds for HuffPost. explaining that the droid’s beeps and boops start out as spoken words behind the scenes. That obviously made for a convenient way to hide the line. Johnson told us he thought it would be cool to sneak in the iconic phrase. “It seemed like a fun character to deliver that line.” he said. “I think originally I had Poe respond. ‘Oh. I got a good feeling about it. Keep your chin up.’ And then I made it a little less explicit just to make it more fun.” Though Johnson happily corroborated that Easter egg. he was more vague about a line that comes from R2-D2 later in the film. At one point. Luke tells R2 to “watch your language.” Asking about what R2 said there proved a little too much for Johnson. The director said the words were “not fit for print!” Now we know why that droid’s monologues are always beeped out.

Harry Potter got the information about horcruxes out of the potions master. and ScreenCrush’s Erin Whitney seemed to just pull off a Potter on him. too. Whitney asked Slughorn himself. actor Jim Broadbent. about his mysterious “Game of Thrones” Season 7 role. and the actor was as forthcoming as though Whitney had been in the Slug Club. “I’m a maester. an archmaester. I’m an old professor character.” he said. The actor also revealed he does scenes with Sam Tarly (John Bradley) and appears in five episodes. adding. “I did sort of one major scene in each episode.” Thus far. it’s been theorized that Broadbent will play Marwyn. who’s an archmaester of the Citadel in George R.R. Martin’s books. Broadbent’s answer basically confirms that. If he is indeed Marwyn. prepare for him to make a big impact. In the books. Marwyn meets with Sam. hears about how Maester Aemon wanted to get support to Dany. and supposedly heads off to find and possibly counsel the Mother of Dragons. Marwyn’s methods are seen as somewhat unorthodox compared to other maesters. so who knows what he’s up to for sure? But the dude appears to be sympathetic to dragons. There might be a problem. though. In the books. the maegi Mirri Maz Duur supposedly studied under Marwyn. Fans will probably remember that Dany burned her in a fire in Season 1 to help bring her the dragons to life. An awkward meeting could be coming ...

entertainment,Kevin Bacon Will Come After You If You Talk Or Text During A Movie,Kevin Bacon has a badge. and he’ll use it to shut you up. In a fun public service announcement from Alamo Drafthouse Cinema on how to behave at the movies. the actor plays a cop who breaks through the screen barrier to silence the talking and texting shmos. “Hey. you. Drop your phone and put your hands in the air.” he tells one audience member. “I sentence you to life in jail for crimes against cinema.” You tell ‘em. Kevin. The short cleverly ties in with Bacon’s new role as a corrupt sheriff in the thriller “Cop Car.” which will be released in August. In fact. it’s “Cop Car” that’s playing during the clip when Bacon busts in. But we wish the actor could pop up in uniform anytime someone interrupts a film.
entertainment,Geena Davis Doesn’t Think Hollywood Has Changed Much Since ‘A League Of Their Own’,Geena Davis is best known as the star of “A League Of Their Own” and “Thelma & Louise.” But for over a decade. Davis has held something of a second career as a proponent of better women’s roles in film. In 2004. she created the Institute on Gender in Media to ﻿further her cause. And last year. she founded the Bentonville Film Festival to champion stories told by. and starring. female and minority voices. Critics sometimes cherry-pick commercially successful titles with strong female leads to prove studios are undergoing a deep transformation in how they regard women. Davis. however. said the movie industry still only regards successful films with prominent female stars as exceptions to its unstated rule: Audiences prefer to hear stories told by white men. “They say. ‘Well. now things are better. because there’s been ‘Hunger Games.’ There’s been ‘Frozen.’’ But no. those were also one-offs. The numbers yet have not moved in decades.” the actress told The Huffington Post. Davis was speaking from personal experience when she said no one movie has changed the industry’s biases. In an interview for Harper’s Bazaar’s May edition. she recalled the reaction to “Thelma & Louise” in 1991 from cultural commenters excited that the film’s popularity might inspire more female buddy comedies or action figures — spaces typically dominated by men. “The really short answer is. it didn’t do shit.” she told Harper’s. Elaborating on her earlier comments. the actress told HuffPost about the similar public reaction to “A League Of Their Own” in 1992. “Suddenly everyone was like. ‘This rewrites everything.’” she said.”Then. you know. name the [women-led movies] that came out since then.” Research on Hollywood’s treatment of women and minorities on screen continues to inspire dismal headlines. This year’s University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism report on diversity found that just one-third of speaking roles in 400 films released between 2014 and 2015 were performed by women. And only about 28 percent of speaking characters were non-white. “We really have to get the momentum going. I don’t know how much more proof we need.” said Davis. whose organization also funds research on diversity in entertainment conducted by USC. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has found a consistent lack of female characters in film — hovering at or just below one-third of speaking characters for over 25 years. One bulletproof line against the industry’s rule. she said. is the massive success of December’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and its female main character. Rey. “Men are no longer allowed to say. ‘Men don’t want to watch female characters.’” she told HuffPost. “We just have to get over that idea. because men will watch female characters if they’re interesting. if they’re fleshed out. if they’re not just one-dimensional eye candy.”
lifestyle,Endometriosis Symptoms And Treatment Explained. From Heavy Periods To Pain After Sex,Endometriosis affects one in 10 women of reproductive age here in the UK – that’s roughly 1.5 million people. It causes sufferers to experience extremely painful or heavy periods. pain during and after sex. and fertility issues – all of which can greatly impact their lives. But disturbingly. it takes. on average. seven years for women to get a diagnosis from the onset of their symptoms. states health charity Endometriosis UK. Think you might be affected? Here’s what you need to know. What is endometriosis? Endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found outside of the womb. These pieces of tissue can be found in many different areas of the body. but they are most commonly found on the ovaries. on the lining of the pelvis. behind the uterus and covering the top of the vagina. states NHS Choices. The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown. but there are several theories. One of them is that the womb lining (endometrium) flows backwards through the fallopian tubes and into the abdomen instead of leaving the body as a period. This tissue then embeds itself on the organs of the pelvis and grows. Another is that the condition is hereditary. being passed down through the genes of family members. Endometriosis symptoms Symptoms of endometriosis include painful periods or heavy periods; pain in the lower abdomen. pelvis or lower back; pain during and after sex; bleeding between periods and difficulty getting pregnant. Other. lesser-known symptoms include: long-term exhaustion and tiredness; discomfort when urinating or passing stools; bleeding from the back passage or finding blood in your stools and coughing blood (this occurs in rare cases where the endometriosis tissue is in the lung). Diagnosis and treatment The condition can be difficult to diagnose because of the common symptoms – namely abdominal pain and heavy periods – which can be attributed to many other conditions. Additionally. in some cases. women suffering from endometriosis might not have any symptoms at all. Endometriosis can be diagnosed with a laparoscopy – a surgical procedure that allows a surgeon to access the inside of the abdomen – or through a very detailed ultrasound scan. There is no cure for the condition. so treatment usually combines a mixture of painkillers and hormone treatment to help make daily life more manageable. Treatment will also depend on several factors such as age. symptoms. desire to have kids. how you feel about surgery. and previous treatments. The first port of call is often pain medication. such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. Hormone treatment. including the combined oral contraceptive pill. is another option to limit or stop the production of oestrogen in your body. This is because oestrogen encourages endometriosis tissue to grow and shed. Dr Helen Webberley. from My Web Doctor. previously told HuffPost UK the contraceptive pill could prove to be an effective treatment for mild endometriosis. “The treatment of mild to moderate endometriosis is to suppress ovulation and stop the monthly cycle of endometrial build up and the best way to do this is to use the contraceptive pill. something which can be done without the need for invasive tests.” she said. “If this stops the pain and bleeding then you are closer to a diagnosis. Suppressing ovulation will stop the damage that endometriosis causes. saving the fallopian tubes and helping to promote fertility.” Progestogens may also be used. which prevent the lining of the womb and any endometriosis tissue from growing quickly. however there are side effects such as weight gain. mood changes and irregular bleeding. Some people may opt to have surgery to remove or destroy areas of endometriosis tissue. The main options are a laparoscopy. to cut out endometriosis tissue. or a hysterectomy. where the womb is removed. Concerns Lack of research into the condition means many women are left suffering without the support they need. According to a survey by Endometriosis UK. 25% of its membership had considered suicide because of the condition. Meanwhile a study in 2011 found that endometriosis accounts for a significant loss of productivity among sufferers. equating to roughly 11 hours per woman. per week. Jane Hudson Jones. chief executive of Endometriosis UK. previously told the Guardian: “It can be absolutely devastating. It can affect pretty much every area of your life – your work. career. income. relationships and fertility.”
lifestyle,Canada's Funniest Place Names,American talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s quest to become mayor of the memorably-named town of Dildo is drawing unprecedented attention to the small Newfoundland hamlet. But we can’t let Dildo have all the fun! It’s definitely not the only place in Canada with an unintentionally funny name — it’s not even the only hilariously named place in Newfoundland. Here are some of the other Canadian places Jimmy Kimmel and his ilk might be interested to visit. Blow Me Down Provincial Park. Newfoundland How and why? No idea. but it really does look beautiful. Spread Eagle. Newfoundland Conveniently located just a 20-minute drive from Dildo! Come By Chance. Newfoundland This town was initially referred to as “Comby Chance.” but the name changed colloquially to the more whimsical (and hilarious) name it has now. Fun fact: there’s also a Come By Chance in Australia. Balls Creek. Nova Scotia When British office and Canadian politician Ingram Ball gave his name to several of the areas on Cape Breton Island. he probably didn’t know how funny it would be a couple centuries later. Saint-Louis-du-Ha!-Ha!. Quebec There are several possible reasons for the town’s name. as detailed on its website. It could also be a garbled version of the Huron word “ahaha.” which means road. It may be a variation on a surprised noise explorers made when they were surprised to see the lake: “Ah! Ah!” Or it could come from an archaic French expression meaning an unexpected obstacle. Where the exclamation marks came from we can’t be sure. but it’s the only place in the world with two exclamation marks in its name. a fact that’s won the town a Guinness World Record. Emo. Ontario The town that shares a name with everyone’s favourite teenage “rebellious” phase is a small rural township near the US border. It’s known for the not-particularly-emo activities like fishing. hunting and stock car racing. Crotch Lake. Ontario According to a website about the region’s campgrounds “Crotch is one of the largest and most accessible” of the lakes in the area. and is mostly undisturbed. A person must first request access before they can proceed into Crotch. Finger. Manitoba Finger is a very small community. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of available information about why it’s called “Finger.” but if you have that info. please don’t hesitate to get in touch. Eyebrow. Saskatchewan The village is named after an eyebrow-shaped hill called. appropriately enough. Eyebrow Hill. What exactly does an eyebrow-shaped hill look like. you ask? It’s hard to know. because as it turns out. “eyebrow hill” is an incredibly unhelpful term to Google. Elbow. Saskatchewan No. it’s not named after an elbow-shaped hill — it’s named after its location at the elbow of Lake Diefenbaker. Climax. Saskatchewan The incredibly named Climax. Sask. got its name from the Minnesota hometown of some of the people who settled in Saskatchewan in the early 20th century. (Climax. Minn. was apparently named after a chewing tobacco company.) Last year. Climax was honoured by internet porn giant Pornhub. which offered all of the town’s residents a free lifetime membership to their premium streaming service. A Pornhub staffer told CBC News that “a name is worth celebrating. rather than subject to incessant ridicule.” (Bonus: One HuffPost staffer who used to work in the prairies was very pleased to once be able to sign off a broadcast with the words. “reporting from near Climax. Saskatchewan.”) Stoner. British Columbia Another very small town with a tiny population. this one located just south of Prince George. As Vancouver rents reach astronomical prices. maybe B.C. residents should consider making Stoner their home base.
lifestyle,Plastic Inflicting 'Appalling Damage' On Marine Life. Sir David Attenborough Tells Prince William,Human beings must not lose our connection with nature. and should wake up to the fact that our actions can have negative consequences on the natural world. Sir David Attenborough warned in an interview with the Duke of Cambridge in Davos on Tuesday. The legendary 92-year-old presenter. whose highly successful career spans six decades. told Prince William that in the 1950s. when he first started making nature documentaries and the world felt “unexplored”. the idea that humans could cause a species to go extinct was a “foreign” concept. but that now it would be “hard to understate” the urgency of environmental challenges such as climate change. Plastic. Sir David said. is an example of a human invention that has had an unforeseen negative impact. “We already know that the plastic problem is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life – the extent to which we don’t really know.” he added. The impact of plastic was explored in Sir David’s famed Blue Planet series. which featured distressing scenes. including albatross regurgitating plastic from the ocean and feeding it to their young. “A healthy natural world is absolutely essential for human society. We have to recognise that every breath of air that we take and every mouthful of food that we take comes from the natural world.” he said. “and if we damage the natural world. we damage ourselves.” More than ever humans understand the natural world – thanks to TV documentaries taking us “to the bottom of the sea and high in the sky. to the Arctic and to the top of the Himalayas” – but at the same time most of us are more disconnected from nature than ever before. with most of us living in cities. he warned. Asked if he had a message for the business leaders at Davos. the broadcast veteran said: “Care for the natural world – treat it with a degree of respect and reverence. the future of the natural world is on our hands. We have never been so powerful. We can wreck it with ease.” Following his blockbuster Blue Planet series. Sir David has filmed a new eight-part nature documentary series with Netflix called Our Planet. which will be released in April. It is reported to have taken over four years to make across 50 countries. “I started when it was just me. and the cameraman. You don’t make natural history films like that anymore – I think something like 300 cameraman have worked on the series as a whole.” he told the Duke of Cambridge. He urged people not to lose sight of the beauty of the natural world: “If you lose that first wonder [that you have as a child about the world] you’ve lost one of the greatest sources of delight and beauty in the whole of the universe.” he said. “And so caring for that brings a joy and enlightenment which is irreplaceable.”
lifestyle,Anxious. Worried. Stressed: What Is Brexit Doing To Our Mental Health?,It’s been almost three years since 52% of voters in the EU referendum voted for the UK to leave the European Union. unleashing a wave of uncertainty. Will Britain negotiate a deal or crash out of the EU without one? What does that mean for jobs? For property? For the economy? For those EU citizens living in the UK? For many. the constant to-ing and fro-ing has resulted in Brexit fatigue. But for others. the climate of uncertainty has taken a toll on their mental health and wellbeing. Tim (who asked us not to use his surname) has lived with depression and anxiety for more than three years. which he says has been exacerbated by the Brexit vote. “I’m very engaged politically and I was absolutely devastated by the referendum outcome.” he explains. “It’s been dwelling on my mind for the last two years.” Tim. who is 51. stopped working as an IT product director at the start of 2018. Ever since. he has focused his efforts into campaigning against Brexit. But he finds himself stuck in a difficult cycle. He feels he has to act but the more invested he becomes. the greater the strain on his mental state. “It’s a relatively regular thing where I find myself waking up in the middle of the night. mulling over the hopelessness of the situation we’re in.” he says. The issue not only affects those who wanted to remain. Sarah*. 23. from Reading. voted leave at the referendum – a decision she now regrets. Since the vote her mental health has worsened. she says: “I have felt anxious watching the news. seeing how disastrously the negotiations are going and the turmoil being displayed within our political parties.” she explains. “Jobs are worrying me. particularly as I am currently on a year’s contract and will be unemployed in six months time. Also. the cost of things will affect everyone including me.” She also fears for her European friends and their right to live in the UK. which she admits she had not previously thought much about. The possible impact of Brexit on mental health was considered by the NHS Confederation’s Mental Health Network annual conference almost a year after the vote. as the possible implications of leaving the EU became clearer. Elisabetta Zanon. director of the NHS European Office – which acts as a link between the NHS and EU policy which might impact it – reflected on concerns about the consequences of Brexit and the climate of uncertainty on mental health. As well as those directly affected by Brexit (such as EU citizens). the uncertainty was also likely to affect the wider population group who are worried about its consequences on the economy. Zanon wrote. “A climate of uncertainty if perpetrated for a long period of time could impact on the mental and physical health of people. potentially leading to an increase in demand of services.” That uncertainty is already having an effect. reports Professor Sarah Niblock. chief executive of the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP). Many of her members say their clients have suffered a deterioration in their mental health since the Brexit vote. “There is a floating anxiety in the consulting room about the uncertainty lying ahead.” she says. Prof Niblock says voters from both sides have taken Brexit anxiety into therapy with them. “Some [Leave voters] report guilt. while others say they would not have supported the split had they predicted how the process would unfold.” she explains. Steve Bond. who lives in Sweden. returned to the UK to vote Leave – but now regrets it. saying he was “hoodwinked” by politicians. The 23-year-old has anxiety and says the process of Brexit hasn’t helped. “With the whole political climate in the UK and the goings on here in Sweden [the rise of far-right politics] it’s hard to not be concerned about the way things are going.” he explains. “Seeing how it’s all panned out. I do honestly feel guilty for voting for it. Maybe that will change. but at the moment it’s all so fractured.” But not all Leave voters are despairing. Geoff Norcott. a 41-year-old comedian from St Neots in Cambridgeshire. says his mental wellbeing did suffer after the vote – but that was due to people’s reaction to him. rather than uncertainty: “Being a stand-up. my timeline was full of my colleagues characterising the likes of me as stupid or racist.” he says. The comedian noticed that at some gigs. when he mentioned his political stance. he’d lose respect from his audience. Speaking on the road from his UK tour. he says he feels optimistic about Brexit: “The scale of vested interests on either side mean that a decent deal is the most likely outcome.” he says. “Even if Brexit isn’t the land of milk and honey prophesied by the more deluded Brexiteers. it won’t be the dystopian sandwichless nightmare feared by many Remainers. “Brexit will be like ‘Bake Off’ going to Channel 4. We were all terrified but in the end it ended up sort of alright.” Optimism is in short supply among younger people. A 2017 poll of more than 4.000 people aged 18-30 revealed that one in three had experienced a decline in mental health since 2016. with nearly half citing Brexit as a cause. The main issues were around the cost of housing and financial security. For the 3.4 million EU citizens and their families in the UK – as well as the 900.000 Brits living in the rest of the EU – the uncertainty has been particularly difficult. Jonathan Portes. Professor of Economics at King’s College London. explains: “While the agreement that. in principle. the vast majority of those affected should be able to obtain ‘settled status’ or a path to permanent residence was very welcome. the recent talk of ‘No Deal’ is very worrying. It would leave them in limbo and unsure of their future.” The Existential Academy in north London offers free counselling to EU citizens living in the UK who are worried about what the future holds. Chartered psychologist Dr Neil Lamont. who runs an emotional support service for Europeans within the academy on a voluntary basis. explains that each person is offered six sessions with one of five fully qualified. accredited practitioners. The service which has helped around 100 people to date. currently has 30 people on the waiting list. There are worries over lack of security. as well as a significant amount of family tension. “Many of our clients are married to British people. or their children go to school here. so they’re very much entrenched here - and some of the wider family may have voted for Brexit.” he says. “There have been all sorts of problems created from that.”The vote is also causing tension among relationships. as witnessed by Prof Niblock. “We have seen relationship and family breakdown as a result of the referendum vote.” she explains. “Couples have actually broken up because they voted differently. There are generational splits. for instance between grandparents and grandchildren who were once close and loving.” Even for couples who voted the same way. the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is causing upset. Paul*. 55. from Kent. who was diagnosed with depression in 2015. says his mental health has since worsened. “It’s caused a lot of tension at home.” he says. “My wife doesn’t feel she can talk about the news. My kids think I’m spending too much time thinking and talking about Brexit. and not on being with the family.” Job security is also an ongoing worry for Paul. who runs a business which imports goods. He has witnessed a 50% decline in income since the vote. “It’s been overwhelming at times - especially when clients are cutting budgets and stopping work due to Brexit.” he says. “I worry about my firm. I’m fighting as hard as I can but I’m working four times as hard for half the money. which means a lot of late nights and weekend shifts.” Peter Cook. 60. from Kent claims Brexit has given him mild symptoms of depression: “I went to the doctor about them. What surprised me was that she was not at all surprised to hear my story – clearly it is not unique.” Gemma (who asked us not to use her surname) says she went into a “kind of depression” for at least a year after the vote. The 41-year-old is British but has lived in Germany for 15 years. where she resides with her husband and three children. She found herself worrying about what her children’s rights would be in the future and how her parents. who live in the UK. would fare: “It made me very reluctant to leave the house — which is a challenge with three kids — and I would cry for no good reason.” It’s clear that political uncertainty can be overwhelming for some people. For those who find things are getting too much. Rachel Boyd. information manager at Mind. recommends taking a break from technology. turning off news notifications on devices or taking time out from social media. “It doesn’t have to be forever. but even a short break might help you feel more rested and able to cope.” she says. “Instead try setting aside some time each day to do something else you enjoy like reading a book. taking up a new hobby. doing some physical exercise. getting outside if you can and connecting with people.” If feelings do persist and are impacting daily life then it’s important to speak to someone about it; whether that’s a friend. family member or GP.
lifestyle,Fighting Fake Fitness News,Fake news has certainly been a topic of much conversation of late. However. fake news is really nothing new. In the fitness industry. some people have been using "fake news" to promote the alleged benefits of their products and/or services for years. Ask anyone and they're sure to be able to name a few wild and crazy fitness fads from years past. Having been in fitness for over 30 years. I've seen more than my fair share. With the rise in online fitness personalities and instagrammers. aka fitstagrammers. the potential for fake fitness news is now massive. Some fitstagrammers' only claim to fame is they look great in a bikini or with their shirts off. Taking nothing away from their dedication to achieving their beach-ready body. their fitness qualifications are often. well. non-existent. Over the last few decades there has been more and more research into most aspects of fitness and diet. As a society. we have access to more information than ever before about how the body works and what we need to do in order to get and stay healthy. At the very least. the internet can provide us with access to some great resources to help differentiate fake news from the truth. If you come across an interesting article or post about fitness. spend just 5 minutes doing the following and you might be able to save yourself a lot of time (and frustration) by not committing to a course of action based on unproven facts: Who wrote the article/post? Are they new to fitness or do they have experience both training themselves and others? What are their qualifications? Do they have any formal training which gives them the knowledge and skills required to educate people on the subject? How many people has it been tested on? If it's just the author. then maybe give it a miss. Is there any scientific research to back their claims? And I mean real science. Not the study done by asking 5 friends how they feel about it. I'm talking scientifically validated results. If you find the article was written by someone reputable and it's got scientific backing. then perhaps give it a go. The one thing I've learnt about diet and fitness is not everything works for everyone. If the article meets the above criteria. give it a try. see how you go. If you get results. excellent. keep going. If not. then move on and try something else.
lifestyle,Troublesome triffids: How to get rid of Japanese knotweed,A Londoner has just been awarded costs and damages of tens of thousands of pounds against a chartered surveyor who didn’t spot Japanese knotweed growing in their garden. In a case likely to have surveyors checking their botanical guide books. the owner sued not only for the cost of the removal of the invasive plant from their property but also of “making good” the garden and distress and inconvenience suffered. The judge also took into account the diminution of value of the property. The owner commissioned a full structural survey when purchasing a ground-floor flat in 2014. The survey made no mention of knotweed so the owner went ahead with the purchase. But the following year. their gardener found signs of the plant. Environet. a company specialising in knotweed removal. confirmed the plant was in three sites in the garden and had been there for at least three years. The owner paid the company to remove it. at a cost of more than £10.000. Japanese knotweed has long been feared by property owners. and London is a hotspot. Just about now. new shoots of the bamboo-like plant are emerging and will quickly reach a height of two metres. while the strong roots can rampage under fences. damage paths and patios and work their way inside the cavity walls of houses. even emerging two storeys up out of the chimney stack. Removing knotweed from the London Olympics site cost £70m. If you allow knotweed to escape from your garden into a neighbour’s you could be prosecuted. or given an Asbo for causing a nuisance. It gets even more problematic if you are moving house. If you have knotweed growing in your garden you must declare it if you sell and this is likely to reduce the value of your property. Mortgage lenders will want an insurance-backed guarantee that the knotweed has been eradicated before agreeing funds to a potential buyer.  Nic Seal from Environet says: “Even when treated there’s still a risk valuers will say there is a residual diminution of the property of two to five per cent.” The costs for knotweed removal in an average London garden. he says. are around £2.500 plus VAT to treat with herbicide and £5.000 to £10.000 to dig it out. So what should you do if you find knotweed in your garden? If you have a major infestation or you plan to sell your home in the next five years. contact a specialist. Most mortgage companies want a firm associated with the trade body the Property Care Association. so check its website to find a member near you. However. if you have only a small clump and don’t plan on moving any time soon. you could aim to get rid of it yourself. says RHS chief horticultural adviser Guy Barter. “It’s evil stuff. It’s a lot of work and not feasible if there’s a vast infestation. but you can dig it out with a spade. “Because it’s classified as ‘controlled waste’. you can’t let any plant material leave the garden. So stack it up to dry on plastic or concrete and then burn it. Or put it in rubble bags and leave it to die for a few years to be sure.” Barter suggests combining digging up the plant with a herbicide such as Roundup. “But if you’re organic. just dig it up.” If knotweed is coming in from a neighbouring garden. he says to dig a deep trench on the boundary and line it with a strong root barrier. Try ecomerchant.co.uk for root block impermeable membrane. from £6.25 per linear metre. Knotweed is the most notorious but by no means the only plant likely to have Londoners tearing their hair out. Bamboo makes a great urban privacy screen. rapidly growing to 6ft. But the roots of “running” varieties can travel 20ft. easily ducking under a fence or wall and popping up next door in the form of thick. spiky shoots. If you plant bamboo. make sure you choose one described as “clump-forming” so it doesn’t get out of control. If your neighbour’s bamboo is coming into your garden. talk to them about it first. suggests Barter. If they won’t remove it. you could offer to pay for a contractor to do it. And if this doesn’t work. dig a trench at least 20in deep and line it with a strong root barrier. In this case. a nice clump of bamboo leaves between you and them might be a welcome thing.
lifestyle,How to repot your houseplants: From warning signs to long-term care,Houseplants. which are trendy again. need repotting every year or two to remain vigorous and healthy. Many of these plants grow naturally in the gloomy floor of the rainforest. and although they have adapted to put up with a lot of root competition. the confines of a pot will eventually become too constraining. Certain common houseplants like to be a little pot-bound – clivias. scheffleras. peace lilies and ficus among them – but even they will need repotting in time. Now. at the start of their annual growth cycle. is the time to do it. Apart from dealing with root congestion. plants that are too long in a pot sit in soil that has become compacted and depleted and may have a harmful accumulation of fertiliser salts. How do you tell whether a plant needs repotting? Turn the pot over: The most obvious sign of a pot-bound plant is roots are growing out of the drainage holes. Hold the lower stem of the plant firmly and pull off the pot. If you see a thicket of pale roots in the shape of the pot. it’s time for action. If the pot won’t slip off. it’s probably gripped by congested roots. If the pot is plastic. you can cut the container away – I use pruners. but mind your fingers. If it’s clay. you may have to break it with a hammer. Another sign of a problem is if the plant seems continually thirsty – that is. wilting – despite diligent watering. This is because the ratio of roots to soil has become too great. The same problem can also lead to an obvious drop in plant vigour. Water the plant thoroughly the day before re-potting to reduce the stress of the ordeal and make the roots more workable. Once you’ve got the plant out of the pot. you have to tease the roots into a more natural state. The degree of effort depends on their level of overcrowding. I asked Nate Roehrich. of Brookside Gardens in Wheaton. Maryland in the US. how he deals with the task. We went in search of a plant begging to be repotted and found a cordyline suffering in a one-gallon pot. As we tackled the job I noticed that he is more gentle with the roots than I tend to be. This may be because. a week before. I had to take a large knife to the most congested root system I had seen – on an indoor palm I had purchased just a month earlier. This leads to another point: just because a houseplant is new to you doesn’t mean it is happily potted. Houseplants purchased late in the growing season or in winter have had months to grow thick roots. Buy them – especially if they’re on sale – but be prepared to ready them for the season ahead. The finer the roots. the more gentle you should be. One way to work them loose with minimum harm is to wash away the old soil with a light stream of water. preferably not ice cold. On roots that are fine but stringy. trim them back with scissors. If they are thick and compacted. you can use a knife to score the sides. On really congested roots. such as with my palm. you could use a sharp knife or even pruning saw to remove the bottom inch or so. and then take a three-pronged soil cultivator to liberate roots from one another and the old soil. Roehrich used no tools on the cordyline other than his hands. As a rule. he doesn’t remove more than one-quarter of the root mass when repotting. A root-pruned plant can be returned to the same pot. but it is better to give it a slightly larger home – a pot that is one or two inches more in top diameter. Any bigger and you run the risk of root rot because of increased soil moisture. Some pots are set in a decorative outer or cache pot and others have an integral saucer at the base. but in any event. the new pot must drain. There is a confusing array of soil and compost products for sale. but the one you want for most houseplants is potting soil (or potting mix). This is typically a peat-based concoction lightened with perlite. Some gardeners think potting soil is still too prone to waterlogging and like to add additional perlite. Orchids and succulents need their own special mixes. Keep the plant at the same soil level as before – deeper and you run the risk of the crown rotting – but the soil line should be below the lip of the pot to allow for efficient watering. Hold the plant at the correct level with one hand while backfilling fresh soil with the other. Roehrich then taps the pot a couple of times to get rid of any air pockets. I like to water the plant to encourage the soil to sink. and then repack as needed. After final watering. let the plant rest – away from direct sunlight even if it’s a bright-light plant. Water again when the top of the soil feels dry. Don’t fertilise for a while; wait until you see new growth. which may take two to four weeks. The plant will first put its energy into repairing its roots before converting energy to top growth. Roehrich says. After the plant is repotted. groom the foliage by removing dead. diseased or damaged leaves. The project generates a fair amount of mess. If your deluxe. fully plumbed potting shed is being renovated. you can undertake the task on the patio or balcony on a mild day or indoors in a large plastic tub. A storage container will do the trick. Reviving a plant in this way has a way of restoring the spirits of the indoor gardener as well.
lifestyle,BRITONS STRUGGLE TO FIND TIME FOR A CUP OF TEA AS STRESS TAKES ITS TOLL. STUDY CLAIMS,A study of 2.000 adults found a fast pace of life combined with rising work pressures and a phone that never stops means few people "switch off". Other factors include the stress of being a parent. longer commuting times and financial pressures amid rising costs of living. Two thirds of those polled believe a lifestyle that leaves no time to decompress is taking its toll on health and emotional wellbeing. The research found those who do find the time. only do so for an average of 54 minutes a day. The research also found the difficulties we have switching off mean we’re left feeling "mentally frazzled" twice a week on average. Four in 10 admit their difficulty in unwinding has had a negative impact on their home life. More than half are so busy they have no time to take a tea break. However. six in 10 feel said they feel apprehensive about straying from their daily routine. Despite this. the Twinings research carried out through OnePoll. found many of those polled have made changes to their daily routine to help them better relax. These include taking longer tea breaks during their working day. not looking at their mobile devices in the evening and reading a book before going to bed. Other methods include taking more tea breaks. doing exercise and enforcing a ‘no talking about work’ rule when at home.
lifestyle,BOOHOO PRAISED FOR SHOWING BODYSUIT MODEL'S STRETCHMARKS,Fashion retailer Boohoo has been praised for an advertising campaign in which a model’s stretch marks are proudly on display. The image. posted to the shop’s website this week. shows a woman modelling a £9 white bodysuit with unedited stretch marks on her thighs. Several shoppers have taken to Twitter to applaud Boohoo’s decision not to edit the marks out. One shopper tweeted: “Well done @boohoo for not feeling that this gorgeous girl’s stretch marks had to be airbrushed out. Glad to see some normality favoured over the usually idealised image. While another wrote: “They have weight on their hips. they have bums. they have stretch marks! Thank you for promoting positive body image. “What a game changer. The rest of the fashion industry should learn from this.” This isn’t the first time the fashion brand has featured models with stretchmarks. which are often airbrushed out in fashion shoots by many brands. Last June. an image of a model wearing a high-rise yellow bodysuit was widely praised for showing her striped bottom and thighs. and over the past few months a number of images of models in lingerie showing off their strechmarks have featured on their site. The retailer is known for promoting body positivity. often using a wide range of models of different shapes and sizes and launching a plus-size range with TOWIE and Dancing on Ice star Gemma Collins. Stretch marks are narrow lines that occur on the surface of the skin. and affect most women. They are usually caused by pregnancy. puberty. rapid weight gain or having a family history of them. Last month. model Chrissy Teigen said that airbrushing scars and stretch marks from photographs was “insane”.
lifestyle,The sound of silence? Lull yourself to sleep with soothing white-noise apps,On winter nights. the white-noise app on my phone is tuned to Air Conditioner: a raspy. metallic whir that sounds like the mechanical noise that might echo deep inside the ductwork of a huge commercial building. (Among the app’s other offerings are Dishwasher Rinsing. Crowded Room and Vacuum Cleaner.) It lulls me to sleep nonetheless. because it blankets the din in my apartment (the ragged snore of a roommate; the clanking of the steam radiator; the cat’s skidding pursuit of something only he can see). It may also soothe because it replicates an early sound environment. probably that of a city childhood. though perhaps it suggests something much. much older. Some sleep experts note that babies. their ears accustomed to the whisper of the maternal circulatory system and the slosh of the womb. sleep better accompanied by a device that mimics those familiar whooshings. My app is but one note in the mighty chorus of white-noise generators. an exploding industry of mechanical and digital devices; apps and websites. and Sonos and Spotify playlists that grows ever more refined. as if to block out the increased rate of speeding. the wrecks. on the information superhighway. Car Interior? Oil Tanker? Laundromat? These ballads are in the vast soundscape library created by Stephane Pigeon. a Belgian electrical engineer. and ready to play on Mynoise.net. a sound generator he put online in 2013 that now has 1 million page views each month. It’s a nearly philanthropic enterprise. as it runs on donations. “I have enough stress.” Pigeon says. Reddit. among other message boards. offers DIY white-noise hacks for light sleepers. shift workers and tinnitus sufferers. Rough up the blades of a box fan with a box cutter. suggests Christopher Suarez. a field service technician from Riverside. California. whose wife is an insomniac. on one captivating thread there. The first domestic white-noise machine may have been built in 1962. by a travelling salesman whose wife grew used to the air-conditioners in the motels they frequented and was unable to sleep at home. But white noise was identified by engineers as early as the 1920s. Pigeon says. and used as a test signal because. as he puts it. “it’s the sum of all the audible frequencies in equal proportion in a single sound. It’s so named because of its analogy to light. which turns white when all visible frequencies are summed up into a single beam.” Back home in his garage. Jim Buckwalter. the salesman. set a turntable and a fan blade into a dog bowl insulated by some foam. and invented the Marpac SleepMate. now called the Dohm (£64.99 on Amazon). a gizmo whose popularity grew by word-of-mouth and became a favourite not just of light sleepers but also of psychotherapists. the legal and medical community. and others seeking to mask confidential conversations. (Nothing says Upper West Side analysis like the whispery hiss of a mushroom-shaped Dohm.) Sound purists adore it because its mechanical whirring is closer to truly random and contains no loop. as many digital versions do. Blocking the bullfrogs Fred Maher is a veteran music producer and drummer who works as an audio engineer and audio-quality tester. He has what are considered golden ears. meaning he is an expert listener who can spot audio errors in music. film and television content. He also suffers from tinnitus. a condition he soothed for years with machines like the Dohm. (That device is now in the bedroom of his six-year-old daughter. Ruby.) White noise. he writes in an email. “is one of the first things we hear from our first moment of existence. in utero (not the Nirvana album). It’s what you hear in a seashell. kind of. The seashell is a mechanical filter that focuses and amplifies ambient noise.” Sleep is inherently dangerous. says Rafael Pelayo. a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Stanford Centre for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. This is why we are wired to sort sounds as we sleep. he says. to differentiate the threats. or a baby’s cry. from more benign noises. “How can a mother feed her baby if the ability to wake up is not wired into our brain?” Pelayo says. “The thalamus needs to decide if a noise is worth informing the cortex. There’s a concept in sleep called the arousal threshold – it’s the stimulus you need to go from a deep sleep to awake. It can be a loud noise. like a garbage truck. or something soft. like your partner saying. ‘Honey. I think there’s a burglar in the house.’ The idea of a noise generator is to raise the background noise so you don’t notice the sounds that aren’t worth your attention: a snoring partner or the hotel elevator.” Pelayo is on the board of Adaptive Sound Technologies. which makes Lectrofan (£45 on Amazon). a digital. but non-looping. version of the old analog noise machines. but he stresses that Stanford does not endorse products. There is no data that suggests a white-noise machine alters the frequencies of the brain. says Param Dedhia. the director of sleep medicine at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson. Arizona. “But we can show that if you make a loud sound. you can affect your response to that with a noise machine. It’s called auditory masking.” Dedhia describes its effects as a sound bubble. “a force field of sound such that a noise has to be much stronger to break through”. Dedhia has deployed Marpac Dohms in the bedrooms at Canyon Ranch. and also in his home because the pool there draws an army of bullfrogs after dark. Their nightly chorus drives him bananas. “Oh. my friend.” he says. “it sounds like someone dying. I used to get my hose and spray them off the sides of the pool. but they soon were on to me. and after a while just hopped back on. So now I have my humidifier running. and the white noise right next to the bed. It’s my sound bubble. We don’t have to have a bug or pill for every ill if we can soothe ourselves. It’s a skill. it really is. If we could all self-soothe. it would make it easier to handle other chaos.” What is noise. anyway? Dedhia likes this definition. from the authors of a sleep study: “Noise is defined as unwanted sounds that could have negative psychological and physiological effects.” Noise is terribly subjective. There are those who love the croak of a bullfrog. and are soothed by the snores of their partner because it means they are close. Pigeon allows that snoring is particularly tough to mask. given its locality (next to your head) and unpredictability (your ears crane for the next growl or explosive sigh). “You must convince yourself the sound of snoring is beautiful.” he says. “I have some people who asked me to put snoring on the website because they are used to sleeping with a partner snoring. and when that partner is gone – travelling or divorced or dead – they miss that sound.” “I have some snoring hidden in one of the generators.” he says. “It’s called Berber Tent. It’s an attempt to take you on a nice story. You are in the desert on vacation and it has been a very warm day and you are all snoozing in the tent together while food is prepared. You can hear the breeze. and the tent flapping and the sound of a man snoring. I didn’t set out to do that. but I always am waiting for opportunities and I was on a trek and I heard it and I taped it. I think if you imagine a beautiful young Berber sleeping next to you. it will change your mind.” Worth a try. Is the world noisier? An insomniac himself. Pigeon is not soothed by his soundscapes because he knows them by heart and will fret over dissonances only he can perceive. “A particular wave on the Irish Coast that crashes too loudly. or a bird that sings in the wrong place.” he says. “I have a brain that can’t stop working.” he adds sadly. “I haven’t found a way to stop its chatter.” Is the world noisier? New York City certainly is. In 2016. there were 420.000 complaints to the city’s hotline for non-emergency services. more than twice as many as there were in 2011. An analysis of that noise data revealed that bad behaviour – loud music and parties – made up the majority of the complaints. followed by banging and pounding sounds. Alan Fierstein. an acoustic consultant and noise-abatement expert. says the city is empirically noisier because there’s just more of everything. More construction. more cars. more people and. most important. more attitude. “One man’s castle is usually above another man’s castle.” Fierstein says. “You have this huge amount of real-estate appreciation. and people are paying a lot of money and as a result they feel like they can do what they want.” Many co-ops and condominiums are now requiring. he says. that an acoustic consultant like himself attest that a proposed renovation. “with its media rooms and central air-conditioning and apartment combinations that put his fancy new kitchen over your son’s bedroom.” will not produce any undue noises. Fierstein can design noise programmes that are perfectly tuned to block the pure tones. as he puts it. of outside irritants. like bus noises or building mechanicals. that can be played on any speaker system. (He describes a pure tone as any sound that has a specific and constant musical pitch. and then demonstrates by making a high beeping noise into the phone.) “The way to block a noise is not to be as loud or louder” than the offending sound. he says. “You also have to produce sound that’s on the same frequency. One of the things that makes noise so unreasonable is the lack of control. You can’t stand your neighbour’s loud music even if it’s your favourite artist. One benefit of masking noise is that you can call it your own.” Recently. Fierstein was called in to mediate a dispute between two neighbours. one of whom was so irked by the sound of the other’s air-conditioner that he positioned eight white-noise machines throughout his studio apartment. the noise of which then annoyed the air-conditioner man. It was the noise-machine man who sent for Fierstein. His report noted that the air-conditioner. a window unit. was emitting “audible pure tones”. he says. and may have been improperly mounted. shaking the framing of the building. That would be a win for noise-machine man. though the building’s management has yet to weigh in. Suarez. the technician whose recipe for a roughed-up box fan appeared on Reddit. suggests that the increased racket we hear is more often living in our heads. The noises we use to “quiet” them are a kind of placebo. he says. Suarez notes the constant commotions of the news cycle and social media. and made the point that we don’t do enough physical activities during the day to dissipate our energies. “Even if you turn off the pings on your phone and turn away from your devices.” he says. speaking from his van as he drives to a job. “you’re still thinking. ‘What’s happening with Facebook? With congress?’ There is so much going on. and so little resolution. When was the last time you heard the end of a story?”
lifestyle,Japanese onsen - the ultimate in relaxation,Okuhida is famous for its hot springs. and especially its rotemburo (outdoor baths) with stunning views of the surrounding Northern Japan Alps. Five onsen towns have developed along Okuhida's valleys. each with its own unique character and hot spring water. as they are fed from different water sources. Onsen are fundamental part of Japanese culture and it's in places like this where Japanese people love to go to leave behind the hectic pace of city life and enjoy the ultimate in relaxation. The idea of wellbeing in Japan is totally different from the Western concept. In Japanese spas. clients are not expected to follow diets or detox treatments. In fact. food is actually a large part of the experience. They eat three proper meals - breakfast. lunch and dinner - and also drink beer and sake. The water of the onsen is very hot - between 37 and 40 degrees. Yoko Nojiri is the landlady at the Hotakaso Hotel's resort. She explains the attraction of these hot spring baths: “What is really enjoyable is the morning bathe. relaxing in the onsen in the early hours of the day when the air is fresh. and you can gaze at the Japanese Alps - it's an amazing experience.” But it's not just beneficial for the mind. for years Japanese scientists have been documenting the positive impact onsen can have on human health. Some studies have shown that hot spring water. depending on its mineral composition. can help people recover from certain surgeries and control a number of conditions. including rheumatism. neuralgia. hypertension and skin diseases. Yoko Nojiri says people in Japan love to go in the onsen at all times of the day. even after dinner to relax before sleeping. And believes they are ideal places to reconnect with oneself and nature.
lifestyle,Jonas Kaufmann stars in the mysterious opera “Die Tote Stadt”,Premiering at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. “Die Tote Stadt” (The dead city) is a story about grief; a man who lost his wife. Marie and can’t move on. After eventually falling in love with her look-alike Marietta. Paul is torn between desire and a feeling of guilt. “The rooms which split up and are put back together reflects the inner conflict." says Nikolaus Bachler. from the Bavarian State Opera. "I think the stage designer translated that very well. You can also imagine a city in itself. a psychological space. It’s a Sigmund Freud-space.” “That bathroom is up on the top of the other building. And Paul is downstairs. It creates this feeling like you're in a dream and you cannot reach something even if you feel that you can. because it's not that far away.” says Baritone Andrzej Filonchyk. The exceptional work has a difficult score written when the composer was just 23 years old. as director. Nikolaus Bachler explains: “Technically speaking it’s almost unfeasible what the tenor has to do in the first act.” Jonas Kaufmann. who sings the tenor part agrees: “I think it’s partly because of Korngold’s young age that he didn’t know how far he could go (where the limits of the voices are). All that he had in mind. all these incredible changes of harmony and rhythm. It’s a crazy maze made up of different styles.” Expressive sounds. finesse and psychedelic melodies. the opera challenges a maestro. “Listen to the orchestra pit and watch what is happening there! It’s something you will hardly find anywhere else. Especially with such a difficult oeuvre. How Kirill Petrenko partly dissects it but without ever losing the poetry." says Bachler. "At the same time. there are these contradictions. these breaks and these surprising flashes which almost bring us back to Hitchcock.” After a nightmarish trip into the depths of his mind. Paul kills Marietta. but only in his dreams. But can he finally move on? “I think that this is a nice idea to leave it unknown or unclear. And even Korngold wrote it in his score. that the stage has to be open till the last bars of the music." says Baritone Andrzej Filonczyk. "The curtain has to stay up and show the emptiness of the stage.”
lifestyle,La Mer: inside Dubai’s top beach location,Here’s how to spend a full day at one of the city’s most popular seaside spots La Mer may only have been open for two years. but it has in that time become one of Dubai’s most popular beach spots. thanks to the mix of family-friendly activities and attractions. not to mention the brightly coloured graffiti. that makes for the perfect selfie spot. With dozens of shops and restaurants. a water park. a cinema and all sorts of sports to try. it’s easy to while away an entire day here. Here’s how… Breakfast Breakfast at Parker’s is a great way to start the day. Diners can opt for something indulgent – we suggest the Benedict croissant with truffle-infused mushroom sauce – or choose a healthier dish. such as avocado on sourdough toast or a tropical açaí bowl. It’s a particularly good pick for those with special dietary requirements. Beach time Spend the rest of the morning on the beach. where you can rent a cabana or daybed. or simply lay out a towel on a free spot of sand. Visitors can laze under the sun or get involved in some water sports. which can be booked at the Watersports by First Yacht kiosk. Options include stand-up paddleboarding. kayaking. jet-skiing. fly-boarding. surfing. boat cruising and more. Prices range from AED35 (€8.65) for 30 minutes on an inflatable up to AED2.350 (€580) for four hours of wakeboarding. Lunch There are 60 food and beverage outlets to be found throughout La Mer. so there are plenty of options for lunch. For something fusion. choose Sikka Café. where Emirati food meets Indian and Iranian influences. This includes hot and cold mezze dishes. a range of steaming-hot breads (from naan to paratha and manakeesh). seafood and meat grills. plus a selection of lighter salads. While most venues in La Mer are unlicensed. and do not serve alcohol. one that does is American-style sports bar Stars N Bars. a concept that hails from Monte Carlo. The atmosphere is lively. with punters watching matches on the TVs. playing arcade games and tucking into the hearty fare. which spans everything from steak to tacos. Shopping and jumping There are a couple of dozen shops dotted around La Mer. too. so retail therapy is most definitely an option too. with everything from cosmetics and sunglasses to swimwear and souvenirs on offer. Children (and the young at heart) can also check out Hawa Hawa. an inflatable playground – similar to a trampoline park – where there are two dunes and seven peaks on which to jump around and enjoy some low-impact. high-intensity fun. Prices start from AED25 (€6.18) for 20 minutes. Laguna Water Park A few hours spent in family-friendly Laguna Water Park are certainly not wasted. There’s something for everyone here. such as a surf simulator. five slides – including the family raft ride Manta – and a lazy river. There is also a dedicated kids’ zone. which features a splash pad and RainFortress (a water play structure under which the little ones – much to their delight – get rained on). Tickets cost AED165 (€40.80). Dinner One of the most sophisticated dining spots in La Mer is Masti. a contemporary Indian fusion restaurant and cocktail lounge that’s perfect for dinner. There are chic and colourful interiors across two floors and outdoor seating areas. and beautifully presented dishes. The menu incorporates international flavours and modern cooking techniques into Indian-inspired recipes – think butter chicken pizza topped with burrata. a bhatti-spiced brisket bao bun with oyster sauce and saag paneer lasagne with coconut-lime sauce. It might sound strange. but it works – very well. Watch a film See in the wee hours by watching a film at The Roxy Cinemas. On the schedule are the latest Hollywood blockbusters. but also art house films and documentaries that cater to audiences of all nationalities. with subtitles in French and Arabic (or English. depending on the movie). Visitors can opt for standard viewing with popcorn or try the La Mer Experience. which includes a three-course gourmet meal with a mocktail that can be delivered to their reclining leather seat. The full experience costs AED225 (€55.64) with pre-booking or it’s AED110 (€27.20) with a seat only.
lifestyle,Innovation. tradition. pop culture: Osaka combines all the elements of the Japanese spirit,Japan's second-largest city. Osaka. is a perfect blend of innovation and tradition. A stop that shouldn't be missed if visiting the country. We begin exploring the city in an unusual and unique way; via boat. in the company of captain of the Ofune-Camome sightseeing boat. Hiromi Nakano. The boat runs all days of the year and a cruise lasts 1 or 2 hours. "Osaka has different faces and when you watch it from the river you can have a global vision of the city." says Captain Hiromi. "You have several routes but the best one is where you can observe the famous Osaka modern architecture and the bridges and also to watch the animated fun of typical Osaka neighbourhoods like Dōtonbori." The boat stops at two different spots. where we can enjoy the magic of this vibrant city: Our first stop is Nipponbashi. a must-go area for animation. video games. manga and 'cosplay.' Cosplay is the practice of dressing up as a character from a film. a book or a manga. In the cosplay centres. people can meet up. take pictures when all dressed up and have fun together. To finish the day with a flourish. we head up to the top terrace of Umeda sky Building. from where you can have a stunning view of the city. 
lifestyle,Why celebrity chefs flock to Dubai,The Middle East has yet to get a Michelin guide. but that hasn’t stopped Michelin-lauded chefs from around the world from flocking here to open iterations of their famed restaurants. Here is a list of the best and most talked-about eateries that could – eventually – be in line to win a star of their own. miX Dubai by Alain Ducasse Michelin’s second-most decorated chef of all time is no stranger to extravagance. yet he only opened his first UAE restaurant in early 2019. The Frenchman. whose Au Plaza Athénée in Paris was placed 16th on the latest World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. launched the three-level miX by Alain Ducasse at the Emerald Palace Kempinski Dubai. the interiors of which feature a 20 metre-high gold Fabergé egg. The menu focuses on seasonal produce and combines a range of culinary influences. including from the Middle East. Asia and South American. merged with the Monégasque chef’s French heritage. Hell’s Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay In late 2018. TV chef Gordon Ramsay opened his second Dubai restaurant at Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai. Recreating the same show-stopping theatre and top-notch cooking of great British cuisine as seen at its original Las Vegas branch. the Emirates' version of Hell’s Kitchen. inspired by Ramsay's reality TV show of the same name. has been attracting a steady stream of discerning diners ever since it opened. The British chef. famed for his fiery outbursts. is also behind the few London eateries to win three Michelin stars. with his restaurants winning a total of 16 stars over the years. For a more casual dining experience. visit Ramsay’s other Dubai restaurant. Bread Street Kitchen. at Atlantis. The Palm. Marina Social by Jason Atherton British chef Jason Atherton worked for Gordon Ramsay Holdings for nearly a decade before opening his own restaurant company and flagship restaurant. Pollen Street Social. back in 2011. The London restaurant was awarded a Michelin star within just six months of opening. and the chef-restaurateur has since gone on to launch well-received eateries across London and another Michelin-starred spot in New York. as well as outlets in Shanghai. Doha. St Moritz and Dubai. Marina Social is particularly special. however. because of its gorgeous location. From the terrace. diners can overlook the glittering Dubai Marina. while enjoying Mediterranean-influenced dishes and drinks from the extensive cocktail list and wine cellar. which is a centrepiece of the contemporary restaurant. There are regular and vegan à la carte menus. as well as the option to choose a chef’s selection of four. six or eight courses with wine pairing. One must-try is the starter of goat’s cheese churros smothered in truffle honey. The sourdough pizzas here are particular popular too. Torno Subito by Massimo Bottura The man behind Modena’s three Michelin-starred Osteria Francescana. which has been voted the best restaurant in the world. opened his first spot outside of Italy early in 2019. Called Torno Subito. it’s located at the newly launched W Dubai – The Palm and offers a casual Riveria-style atmosphere with whimsical. brightly coloured interiors and beachside seating. The menu features all the classics: burrata. vongole. slow-cooked sea bass. pizza. tiramisu and gelato – to name a few. It’s more upbeat and down to earth than Bottura’s original claim to fame. but Torno Subito offers something entirely different that’s well suited to the bold. modern hotel it calls home. Nusr-Et Rihanna wore a T-shirt with his face on it. That’s how famous the chef behind this chain of steakhouses is. Nusret Gökçe. known globally as Salt Bae. is the Turkish butcher. chef and restaurateur who’s best known for his unique way of preparing and seasoning meat. He became an internet sensation and inspiration for countless memes a few years back and now every celebrity worth their salt dines at Nusr-Et while in Dubai – from footballers to Bollywood stars and high-profile politicians – and the man himself will often pop by for a selfie. The restaurant is based in the Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach and the focus here is well and truly on high-quality meat that’s been cooked – and. of course. seasoned – to perfection. All manner of steaks. from Tomahawk to filet mignon. are served. but there are other options too. These include lamb tenderloin. asado short ribs roasted for eight hours. home-smoked organic salmon and giant prawns. There are also souvenirs on sale. including a T-shirt just like Rihanna’s. Be warned: this is no place for vegetarians. Akira Back Japanese cuisine with a Korean twist is what snowboarder-turned-chef Akira Back is known for – not to mention his appearance on Iron Chef America – and what he’s brought to the Middle East for the first time with his eponymous restaurant at W Dubai – The Palm. His Michelin-starred restaurant. Dosa. is based in his hometown of Seoul. South Korea. but he has notable eateries across the world. from Las Vegas to Toronto and Jakarta to Hanoi. His Dubai restaurant has been very well regarded since it opened earlier this year. for its sophisticated ambience. fabulous food and stunning skyline views. It’s also popular among the vegan community. thanks to the abundance of plant-based options. The rooftop terrace. with its floating bar. is a particularly great spot to grab a table. weather permitting. Tasca Portuguese chef José Avillez is behind Lisbon’s first two Michelin-starred restaurant. Belcanto. and he’s recently made his UAE debut with Tasca. at the brand new Mandarin Oriental Jumeira. Tasca is the word for a casual restaurant in Portugal – similar to “bistro” in France – so don’t expect a formal. fine-dining experience. Instead. Avillez’s first international restaurant offers fantastic sea views. a laidback atmosphere and dishes rooted in the chef’s hometown traditions but with a contemporary twist. It also boasts Dubai’s first Portuguese brunch. 
lifestyle,Born To Be Mild,Someone's always telling you what you ought to do. Read the papers often enough and you'll end up at once enlightened and confused. Chocolate will be part of the sugar scare one day. and will save you from strokes and heart attacks the next; red wine will give you cancer in January but save you from it in March. The older I get. the less notice I take. presuming that my policy of 'everything in moderation' might help avert catastrophe if not mortality. And the older I get. the more I resent those lists of what I ought to have done by a certain age. These 'must do' lists are the middle aged version of the rising scale of exciting things you're allowed to do as you move through your teens. They play on the modern angst of FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out - on things we ought to do before the age of bewilderment. The most recent prescription for a fulfilled middle age was published at the end of March. resulting from a survey of people who had just turned 50. And it makes me feel exhausted. even though I'm quite a way away from that milestone age just yet. I mean: I've done some of the things on the list. I've fallen in love. got married. bought a house. I've definitely read even more than the total 100 books suggested. though I'm not quite sure which hundred books they have in mind. You could read all the Mister Men. for instance. in one night of middle-aged insomnia. I've learned a language - or two. I've said no to my mother. and survived. I've travelled alone. and remember where the petrol cap is without seeing it as any kind of life landmark. I've stayed out all night partying and been sober enough to remember it. and I've seen at least a few favourite bands live. As for perfecting a signature dish: I do a mean fruit salad. A stunning mug of coffee. Astounding breakfast cereal and simply unforgettable gluten free brown toast. My very favourite thing about the Pre 50 list is reading it as a linear narrative. You have to buy a house. have kids. get married. fall in love and THEN eat fish and chips on the pier. There's the narrative arc of a fantastic rom com right there. That done. you have to donate blood. read 100 books. see your favourite band live. learn a language. attend a music festival and own a dog. all the while saying no to your mother just to keep Sigmund Freud in translation as Mr Happy. I've read novels with less of a plot. Once you've stayed out all night partying and seen the Northern Lights. having found your petrol cap. you visit Stonehenge. having travelled there alone. sleep underneath the stars. taking in a meteor shower and. with expert knowledge of the British weather. dance in the rain. This will inspire you to quit your job and visit all seven continents. taking in a volcano. the Trevi Fourntain. trips on a Venice gondola. a helicopter and a hot air balloon. Your journey will include sex on a beach. skinny dipping and swimming with dolphins - terribly efficient multitasking. You'll make a snow angel on Snowdonia and ride an elephant into protest. Somewhere along the line you'll own your own business. perfect that signature dish and jump into a pool fully clothed. possibly to cool down after running that marathon. As you roar up. tattooed. to your 50th birthday on your Vespa. you'll attend an Edinburgh Fringe comedy show. having written both a novel and a journal following a technology-free month. To finish with: try drugs. have a threesome. then go to an airport and pick a random flight. Most of us probably want to grasp the final strands of feeling young. but many will fail at growing old like this. When I look back from the height of that great age. I don't think I'm going to regret my lack of tattoos. hot air balloons. or narcotic close encounters. I think I'd feel more regret if I'd simply done what everyone was made to do. Growing old - or growing up? - shouldn't have the same prescriptive list for everyone. Surely growing old is all about following your own path. working your way through your own list of experiences and turning that into a story of your own? Or maybe I'm just boring. Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I have always been growing old. Maybe I was simply born. born to be mild.

lifestyle,International Women's Day: We Asked Girls And Young Women What Feminism Means To Them,Girls develop perceptions about gender and equality from a young age. We may be more vocal about our drive for equal opportunities as we grow older. but that doesn’t mean young girls don’t have the same thoughts and feelings. We asked 10 girls. who range in age from six to 25. to explain what feminism means to them – and the answers were inspiring. If anything. it shows that you are never too young to call yourself a feminist. Six-year-old Lola told HuffPost UK: “It means sharing. so if a lady has two and a man has four. we have to share it. “So what we do is. we would have to take one from the man and give it to the lady. so they both have three.” Holly. 12. told us that for her. feminism means women have the same rights as men. “Feminism means for women and men to be equal. treated the same. and to be given the same things.” she said. “I don’t understand why men shouldn’t be treated better or given more just because they are not a woman.”

lifestyle,Man Poignantly Asks Internet For Help To Marry His Fiancé Before Her Dad Dies Of Cancer,A man has asked strangers for help to make his dream wedding a reality after his father-in-law was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ryan Byrne proposed to his fiancé Taylor Ramsey on Christmas Eve 2016. after meeting her the year before when they were both studying to become Hospital Corpsman at navy medical facilities in Florida. Byrne said: “Before too long I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. A feeling I had never experienced before. “So I mustered up the courage to ask her. It was hands down the most nerve racking thing I have ever done in my life. But it felt so good to hear her say yes.” The couple. who are now in a long distance engagement. had not planned on getting married any time soon because of their financial position. However. life took a different turn. and Ramsey’s 47-year-old father was diagnosed with aggressive Adenocarcinoma. a type of Oesophageal cancer. After several rounds of chemotherapy. he underwent a thirteen-hour operation that held “promising results”. “He maintained a very positive attitude. The outlook was positive. and for a short while things got better…but women. through clairvoyance. always seem to know when something is wrong.” said Byrne. Just a week before his father-in-law’s “cancer free celebration day” he went for a routine CT scan and doctors found that the initial cancer had now metastasized and there were roughly thirteen tumours in his brain. In November 2016. the whole family was told that the illness was terminal and organised an ‘end of life’ cruise holiday to Mexico to spend time together. Now Byrne has taken to Imgur to ask people to vote for the couple to win a competition for military couples to win a wedding so that her father can be present and walk her down the aisle. Ramsey wrote on the Castle Farms event page: “It is so important to me to give my father a beautiful wedding where he can walk me down the aisle and give me away to the man I never thought I would find.” The couple are currently in the lead to win the competition. with over 6000 votes.

lifestyle,Update your home for the new year,As our homes shed their Christmas spirits. decorations are retired to attic-bound boxes and wizened pines are propped miserably against suburban kerbs. For so many. much of the joy of Christmas can be found in the adornment of the home: decking the halls. as it were. I know I’m not alone when I say I feel a tangible sense of loss around this time of year. a festering unfestiveness. Home simply doesn’t feel as special. as decorated or as welcoming in the glaring absence of a large spruce. garnished with trinkets from Christmases past. However. this year.

lifestyle,A NEW ERA FOR BURBERRY AS RICCARDO TISCI TAKES THE REINS,Few brands have a history so steeped in controversy as Burberry. The British heritage fashion house has been trying to claw back its reputation ever since news broke in July this year that they had burnt £28.6m worth of unsold stock allegedly to prevent counterfeiting. CEO Marco Gobbetti denounced the practice this month. saying this would no longer happen and swiftly adding that the brand would also no longer be using fur. The words “band aid” and “bullet wound” came to mind. If ever there was a sure-fire way to reinvent a brand’s reputation. it is with a fresh design lead and. on Monday night. London Fashion Week saw the highly anticipated debut of new creative director Riccardo Tisci. But his first collection for the British heritage brand didn’t mark the stark departure from Burberry’s core values that many were expecting. Instead. it toed a respectful line that embraced the brand’s provenance. with a light peppering of what might be in store for future seasons. The spring/summer 2019 collection was presented to a captive audience that. unexpectedly to many. was a largely celebrity-free-zone (except for Marina Abramovic who slipped into in the front row) in the disused South London Mail Centre. It was the catwalk that boasted the big names. no doubt as a way of keeping people’s focus. Tisci sent a star-studded line-up of models including Kendall Jenner. Stella Tennant. Jourdan Dunn and Lily Donaldson down the runway. Founded by Thomas Burberry in 1856. the fashion house has long been famed for its gabardine trench coats (a fabric Burberry himself invented in 1879) that were designed in 1912 to shield officers from the inclement conditions of the front lines. Each detail lending itself practicality. including shoulder straps that enabled soldiers to add epaulettes denoting their rank and D-rings on which to attach maps and compasses. But more than the trench. it is the instantly recognisable nova check of camel. white and red that has become synonymous with Burberry. It became so popular in the Nineties that. in another tone-deaf move. Burberry decided to rein in its production of accessories that bore the plaid. apparently for fear of the brand being devalued by the “wrong” wearers. Announced as creative director in March this year. 44-year-old Tisci joins the brand from Givenchy. where he led the house for 12 years. Tisci follows on from his predecessor Christopher Bailey. who joined the brand in 2001 as design director to reinvent its image and catapult it into the luxury sphere. Over his 17-year-tenure. Bailey made the trench coat the must-have item for every fashion-loving woman (who could afford one). Showing the coats in metallic and studded versions. and casting celebrities like Emma Watson in his campaigns. Bailey dramatically increased revenue and he brought Burberry into the digital age. trialling the “see-now-buy-now” model of catwalk shows which. as it sounds. allowed viewers to purchase items straight from the catwalks. as opposed to waiting the usual six months for a drop. Unfortunately. profit targets were not met towards the end of his occupancy and shareholders docked Bailey’s pay by 75 per cent. His swansong was a jubilant return to the nova check. which he plastered on hats. capes and shirts. It resulted in an immediate streetwear revival of the motif. Kept tightly under wraps until the day of the show. Tisci teased fans with hints of his vision for the brand. First there was the complete overhaul of the classic Burberry logo for the first time in two decades. which the creative director posted on Instagram. The interlocking initials TB. designed by Peter Saville. have since dominated cities across the globe. wrapping across buildings. billboards and black taxis. In an emulation of recently revived brands like Gucci and Fendi. the emblem signals a return to 1980s logomania. Soon after. Tisci dropped the first item of his collection on Instagram and Chinese platform WeChat: a black T-shirt with the logo in white. It went on sale for just 24 hours. Tisci’s track record at Givenchy saw him transform the brand from a Breakfast at Tiffany’s elegance to one that oozed sex appeal through gothic-inspired lace. leather and bondage. Subverting the expectations of the French fashion house in much a similar way that Alexander McQueen did in 1996. he offered diverse models in his shows. became the first creative director of a major house to cast a transgender model when he cast Lea T in his 2010 ad campaign and designed gender fluid clothing such as skirts over leggings for men. Always knowing the power that the streets have upon sales. Tisci’s gorilla and Bambi-print sweatshirts were an instant hit and his celebrity fan base is one other brands would kill for. including Beyoncé. Rihanna. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. He left the brand when umbrella owner. LVMH. had hit record annual revenues. Today’s collection. heavy on homage. marked a careful transition into a new role for Tisci. Not throwing out the rulebook. he instead presented a vast collection that saw the brand’s military origins referenced in men’s suits (yes. there was lots of menswear). which were worn with umbrellas fastened to their backs like rifles. The trench featured heavily. with Tisci twists like edges pierced with brass rings. one covered in silver rivets. another with pearl and feather embellishment and some in a looser. edgier cut. The men’s included one yin-yang trench with a classic khaki bottom half and a black top half. And. of course. nova check made a proud appearance tweaked into stripes on pussy bow blouses worn with high-waisted trousers and inside trench linings. There were plenty of safe items: knife-pleated midi skirts and blazers and a palette of browns and beige. But elements of Tisci’s edgy predisposition shone through: fishnet. buckled Doc Martens-style shoes. slinky black evening dresses. writing scrawled on tops and sportswear stripes. There was a subtle injection of the new logo. seen in silk scarves worn tied into low buns. or hanging from belt hoops and as brass bag clasps. The gorilla and Bambi motifs from Givenchy snuck in. too. with one deer-print top reading “Did they kill Bambi?” An Italian designer in a British house. Tisci found it irresistible to sneak a few Brexit references into the collection. as several models walked the runway with red passports around their necks. Following the show. a number of items from the collection were available to buy on Instagram in further 24-hour-releases. creating a frenzy not dissimilar to that surrounding cult streetwear brand Supreme. Ultimately. it was a collection that marked a courteous transition into a new Burberry era. Tisci’s debut will have left the industry eagerly anticipating what’s to come. safe in the knowledge that the brand’s rich history has been spared the pyre.
lifestyle,SHARP SHAPES AND SUPER-WIDE CULOTTES ON THE MOST ANTICIPATED DAY OF LONDON FASHION WEEK,The penultimate day of London Fashion Week is a big one because. before the style-set bid adieu for one more season. the busiest. and arguably most anticipated. day awaits them. Today. big-gun editors flocked to see Riccardo Tisci’s hotly anticipated collection for Burberry. while other members of the establishment – including Roksanda. Erdem. Christopher Kane and Emilia Wickstead – also drew in the crowds. Elsewhere. a handful of emerging talents and underground brands such as TOGA. Rejina Pyo and Edeline Lee offered a mix of considered collections and presentations which catered for a whole new generation of fashion fans. Here. we take a look at all the best bits from day four of London Fashion Week. Roksanda’s tangerine dream A designer that’s curated an instantly recognisable design aesthetic in the decade since she launched her eponymous label. Roksanda Ilincic has become synonymous with stand-out colour blocking and sculptural shapes. and this season was no different. The Serbian designer’s background in architecture and applied arts is often cited as forming the foundation of her designs. And so. it made sense that she chose to showcase this season’s collection within the Serpentine Pavilion – a building which this year has been designed by Mexican architect Frida Escobedo. and features walls made of concrete roofing tiles. a curved. mirrored ceiling and a shallow. triangular pool of water. Sophisticated and playful. yet entirely effortless. the collection was brimming with impactful silhouettes. vivid colours and surprising textures for a contemporary take on femininity. Here. a rainbow of colours. from tangerine and coral to blue. white. red and pink. swathed satin floor-sweeping dresses. voluminous shapes and loose trenches. Elsewhere. there was far more emphasis on daytime dressing with lightweight knits in offbeat colour combinations. line drawings. striped blazers and super-wide culottes. This was a lesson in how to execute a modern and more feminine version of power dressing. Erdem explores the boundaries of gender norms Easily one of the most anticipated shows of the season. half-British. half-Turkish designer Erdem Moralioglu chose to reveal his collection in the National Portrait Gallery; a location which only served to add to the grandeur of it all. For spring/summer 2019. he cited the freedom of self-expression as his starting point. making particular reference to Frederick Park and Ernest Boulton. two men who were arrested in 1870 while dressed as their female alter egos. Fanny and Stella. Just two figures in a diverse crowd of men and women at the time exploring beyond the prescribed boundaries of sex. it was the idea of dressing up or down to explore one’s individual identity that inspired this dimly lit show. In this instance. the opulence and glamour of Erdem’s aesthetic resurfaced through sumptuous flocked fabrics. long trains that dragged down the corridors and layers upon layers of lace. Elsewhere. the designer’s signature floral prints clashed with vibrant shades of yellow. pink and blue while a handful of gender-bending models emerged wearing blacked-our veiled headwear. corsetry and sharp. tailored suiting with exaggerated shoulders. Never one to disappoint. it was. once again. Erdem’s poignant message combined with his penchant for moments of melancholy that made this a standout show. Mother of Pearl’s painterly presentation A brand that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Mother of Pearl has a fun. playful spirit about it. much of which is thanks to its creative director Amy Powney. A designer who often draws references from her childhood in the North of England and is inspired by the strength of the women that surround her. Powney aims to celebrate femininity and individuality with effortless fashion. The brand’s latest offering looks to the Early Netherlandish painters for inspiration. specifically the work of Jan van Eyck. In this instance. rich and regal tones like emerald green and burnt orange set a decadent mood while light-hearted prints – think golden gilded lions and vibrant blooms – crystallise the brands aesthetic. In contrast. Powney sought inspiration from the bold and forward-thinking haute couture of the 1920s when it came to silhouettes. Here. puffball sleeves. cocoon cuts. cascades of ruching and heeled mules decorated with larger-than-life bows were incorporated as a way of encouraging women to dress for themselves and their love of fashion. A lesson in tomboyish femininity from TOGA One of Japan’s most preeminent brands. TOGA is the brainchild of former costume designer and stylist. Yasuko Furuta. A woman with an avant-garde vision. her collections have become synonymous with statement prints and a tomboyish femininity that combines elements of contemporary Western style and Japanese design. This season. the experimental world of TOGA began with a cryptically titled show called “Sport. Air. Scrunched”. which. as it turns out. was a treasure trove of striking pieces in modern shapes and multi-layered silhouettes. What commenced with an athleisure feel – think cycling shorts. netted trainer-boot hybrids and billowing fabrics worn with skydiving goggles – quickly took an ornate turn. With a series of looks born to be worn after dark. the sporty element was replaced with satin gowns. cinched-in waists. puffball shoulders and the most incredibly intricate frills decorating everything from sharply tailored blazers to languid trenches. Furuta also managed to balance colour in a way we never knew we needed. Crisp white shirts came splattered with vibrant prints. while dabs of almost fluorescent purple flashed through cut-out garments and diaphanous cream dresses were juxtaposed with luminous green booties. It was cool. elegant and multifaceted. For us though. the standout pieces were those that offered tomboyish femininity. specifically the blazer-meets-bomber jackets that came trimmed with tightly-packed ruffle trims.
lifestyle,WHY ‘HOW DO I LOOK?’ IS ONE OF THE HARDEST QUESTIONS TO ANSWER,It’s Saturday night. You’re going out. You’ve been looking forward to this all week. You’ve got your glad-rags on. Your hair’s gone right. You blow a kiss to your reflection in the bathroom mirror and your reflection blows a kiss right back at you. You’re ready to go. “Taxi will be here in 10 minutes.” you tell your loved one / flatmate / party partner for the evening. “Nearly ready.” they assure you. You sit at the bottom of the stairs for the next five minutes. watching the little car icon on the cab app draw closer. “Cab’s by the roundabout now!” Four minutes to go. The cab’s just three streets away. “Another minute!” comes a cry from the bathroom. “Don’t forget they charge waiting time!” You try to hurry things along. With two minutes to go. your party compadre finally appears and stands in front of you. wearing what looks like a butcher’s apron (clean) over a pair of lederhosen (possibly not clean). “Ta-daa!” They give a quick twirl and smile at you hopefully before asking one of the most difficult questions known to humankind. “How do I look?” Oh hell. The pin is out of the grenade. Of course. if you’re going to the sort of party where a butcher’s apron over a pair of lederhosen is actually quite a low-key interpretation of the dress code. you’re in the clear. “Perfect. darling! Here’s the car. Let’s go.” But if you’re on your way to your grandmother’s eightieth. your godson’s eighteenth. or any other kind of social occasion where even wearing a perfectly normal leather jacket raises eyebrows and encourages mutterings of “up for a bit of bondage. are we”. then you are in trouble. Your sixty-something cousin Jerry is going to see those lederhosen and throw his keys straight into the fruit bowl. If only your beloved had put on those nice black trousers they usually wear. “Well?” They press for an answer. You could try saying it in body language.  “You look. ah. you look…’ followed by a Gallic shrug combined with the Italian hand sign for “I will kill your personal shopper”. Or you could try suggesting a small outfit tweak. “Maybe with a cashmere sweater on top?” “It’s 30 degrees Celsius out.” Or you could try being honest. “I prefer you in that other thing.” “What other thing?” “Anything. Anything at all.” Whatever you do. if you hesitate to respond. all is lost. Everyone knows that hesitation in answering this particular question really means. “You look like you just escaped naked from a serial killer’s cellar and grabbed a random selection of his clothes on your way out.”   Yet if you’re not open about what you think when someone asks you how they look. aren’t you doing the other person a disservice? You may be wary of hurting their feelings but if you know they’re not looking their best. or are actively looking like a hot mess. aren’t you setting them up to be even more hurt by not saying so before someone else does? Don’t we ask questions in the hope of receiving an honest answer? Well. of course we’d all like to think we do. In reality. what we’re usually after is the real-life equivalent of an Instagram “like” for our banana yellow flares. My personal feeling is that if someone’s dress is tucked in their knickers. you should tell them. Likewise. if their too-tight trousers have split up the back and their undies are on show. you really ought to let them know. But if someone asks you how they look and you can’t see their nipples and you’re pretty sure that no-one will be harmed in the wearing of that outfit. then what the hell? “Darling. you look amazing” is always technically the truth. if you go by the Oxford Dictionary definition of amazing as “causing great surprise or wonder”. Shock and awe in sequinned designer chaps.  Talking of “shock and awe”. perhaps it was fear of hurting Melania’s feelings. by telling her she looked flat out wrong for the occasion. that led to her latest wardrobe mishap. She headed out on an official visit to children separated from their parents at the US border wearing a Zara parka bearing the legend “I really don’t care. do you?” It was a strange sartorial choice to say the least. Why didn’t anybody question it before Melania stepped into the public gaze?  The White House staff may not have wanted to upset the boss’s wife. Instead. people were upset all over the thinking world. Melania’s parka reminded us that while we all like to trot out the old adage that appearances don’t matter. the clothes we choose to wear do send out messages. Not usually a literal message. as in the case of Melania’s parka (which her husband quickly defended as being two fingers to the purveyors of fake news). but important messages none the less. There is a growing industry dedicated to deciphering Melania’s outfits. There were those insanely high white heels she wore when boarding Air Force One en route to visit people made homeless by the storms in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2017. A month later. she wore a see-through top to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. What was Melania thinking when she chose each of these outfits?  Did she not ask anybody “How do I look?” before stepping out in glamour model chic that was bound to distract from the gravity of the occasion? In contrast. there have been moments when Melania has dressed like an extra from The Handmaid’s Tale. The scarlet Alice Roi coat she wore in March 2017 was pure Offred. The voluminous dark burgundy coat-dress she wore on the Trump’s visit to South Korea would have been suitable for a commander’s wife (if it came in green). It was an outfit at the opposite end of the style spectrum from the figure-skimming look her husband typically prefers. The enormous sleeves of the Roksanda dresses Melania sometimes favours are a neat way of preserving personal space if you don’t want anyone touching you with their tiny hands. Are Melania’s wardrobe choices really unthinking or is she actually more like Phyllis Latour Doyle. a British secret agent in the Second World War who sent coded messages in her knitting. Having parachuted into occupied Normandy. Phyllis used her cover that she was an innocent handicraft-crazy local to get friendly with German soldiers. When she heard something important. she went straight to her knitting basket and knotted the information into silk threads using Morse Code. She disguised the silk threads as hair ribbons. In Belgium too. the Resistance sent messages about enemy troop movements knitted into jumpers and scarves. Maybe Melania’s Serena Joy style is a nod to observers that she gets it. Maybe the unfortunate parka was actually two fingers to her husband. Maybe even that see-through top Melania wore as she stood behind Trump at the Hispanic Heritage Month event hid a coded message. “Would you look at this tit?”  “But how do I look?” Going back to your dear friend. dressed for the Ruby Wedding celebrations in a butcher’s apron and the lederhosen. Maybe the way to answer their question is to first ask. “What exactly do you want your outfit to say?”
lifestyle,THE COTTAGE CHEESE APPEAL: IS AMERICA READY TO LOVE THE CREAMY CLASSIC AGAIN?,Cottage cheese began life in America as an easy. economical way for colonial cooks to make use of milk left over after they skimmed off the cream. By the 1970s. its amicable presence in recipes and on diet plates had made it a star. Fame is fickle. and so are the nation’s eaters. Cottage cheese fell out of favour. and now spends its days hanging out in stodgy pint containers near the sour cream. while yoghurt sprawls out across acres of the dairy case. dressed up in cute little tubes. flip tops and French glass jars. America loves a comeback though. and there are plenty of people who are betting that cottage cheese is primed for one. “Every seven years or so another wave comes through where we try to reposition cottage cheese.” says Dave Potter. president of Dairy Connection in Madison. Wisconsin. which sells custom cultures and enzymes to cheesemakers. “That’s about where we are now.” This time. with help from both big food companies and small-batch cheesemakers. it might actually work. On the mass-market side of the equation. the nation’s largest dairy producers are targeting younger people looking for a protein-rich. natural snack they can eat instead of a meal. (Cottage cheese can have twice the protein of some yoghurts. though it has a lot more sodium.) A couple new players have jumped in. including Muuna. the first product from Israel’s largest food manufacturer to be sold in the United States. American companies like Dean Foods. the nation’s largest dairy company. have given their cottage cheeses makeovers. packing them into smaller. sexier packages and asking retailers to move them away from the sour cream and closer to the yoghurt. New lines have interesting mixes of fruit and nuts. and some producers are experimenting with millennial-friendly additions like probiotics and chia seeds. Flavours are expanding beyond dusty stalwarts like pineapple to include Kalamata olive. habanero chile or cumin. The goal. according to industry analysts. is to “uncottage” cottage cheese – or. as one dairy executive put it. “Chobani it”. But the road back is not going to be easy. Yoghurt outsells cottage cheese by roughly 8 to 1. says John Owen. a senior food and drink analyst who prepared the annual cheese report for Mintel. a market research company. Even though yoghurt sales have started to flatten. American shoppers still bought $8.5bn (£7.6bn) worth in 2017. “Yoghurt got adopted by big food in the way cottage cheese never did.” he says. To use the terminology of food marketers. yoghurt wears a “health halo”. Cottage cheese. long linked to the drudgery of dieting. instead is fighting a punishment halo. “Yoghurt always had a better back story than cottage cheese.” says Jonathan Kauffman. author of Hippie Food: How Back-to-the-Landers. Longhairs. and Revolutionaries Changed the Way We Eat. Kauffman. like many people. has let cottage cheese fall out of rotation: “It’s one of those foods I don’t eat. but I feel like I should.” It wasn’t always this way. Cottage cheese was once a reliable character actor. standing in for meat during two world wars. filling in for ricotta and starring on diet plates. It gave heft to salad bars and made a regular appearance (with fruit) on Richard Nixon’s lunch tray. By the mid-1970s. the golden era of cottage cheese. producers in every state were pumping out more than £1bn a year. Yoghurt was considered a weird. sour interloper reserved for European expatriates and health nuts. But then came the 1980s. Fruity. sweetened and sometimes frozen yoghurt had caught on and cottage cheese was going nowhere but down. The rise of Greek yoghurt in the early 2000s knocked it to the mat. Potter thinks salvation won’t come at the hands of Big Cottage Cheese. Mass production. he says. is part of what killed it in the first place. By the 1980s. large corporations had absorbed most regional dairies. and much of the nation’s cottage cheese had become a flat-tasting. low-fat commodity with rubbery curds stabilised with starches and gums. “Really good cottage cheese is a hard product to make that doesn’t take well to automation.” Potter says. Unlike yoghurt. which is a matter of adding a culture to milk and waiting for it to thicken up. cottage cheese is one of those foods that is deceptively simple to produce but difficult to do well. It’s like making really good scrambled eggs. but takes hours. You have to take it low and slow. “Good cottage cheese takes a little craftsmanship.” says Potter. of the Dairy Connection. That’s where cheesemakers like Sue Conley and Peggy Smith. founders of Cowgirl Creamery in Marin County. California. come in. In the 1990s. Conley learned to make cottage cheese from Potter. It was one of the first cheeses she and Smith produced when they opened their original creamery in Point Reyes Station. California. in 1997. The key is very fresh skim milk from a well-run local dairy. Conley says (they get theirs from nearby Bivalve Dairy. which is certified organic and grazes its 200 Holsteins on pasture). Next comes a simple starter culture that feeds on milk sugars to create lactic acid. Overnight. luscious. tender curds slowly form. In the morning. cheesemakers cut them into pieces no bigger than peas. They cook and stir the curds for about one and a half hours to release some of their acidity. Then. the cheesemakers drain the whey and wash the curds three times. The last step is the dressing. which is the term for milk or cream that is added to the curds to make them creamy. The dressing determines the fat content of the cottage cheese. and is where most of the flavour lies. Cowgirl Creamery uses creme fraîche. and calls its pleasantly tart product “clabbered cottage cheese”. The cheese will be sold in Northern California and online. with plans to expand distribution on the west coast in the fall. It’s not inexpensive. A 5.3 ounce container will cost a little less than $3. Conley suggests eating it the way cheesemakers do after they finish a batch: rip open a bag of barbecue-flavoured potato chips and use it like a dip. Cowgirl Creamery interrupted production in 2012 because the process requires a lot of water and California was in a terrible drought. But this month. the creamery has started making the cottage cheese again at its Petaluma. California. facility to the joy of people like Janet Fletcher. a cheese writer who published a love letter to it in The San Francisco Chronicle. “I abandoned cottage cheese when I left home.” she wrote. “Tasting Cowgirl Creamery’s superb product made me want to welcome cottage cheese back into my life.” When cottage cheese is good. it’s delicious. something the cheesemonger Kate Arding found when she tasted Cowgirl Creamery’s version before production stopped. Arding. who grew up eating (and not really liking) cottage cheese in Britain. began a quest to persuade sceptical customers. “They’d taste it and get this glassy-eyed look.” she says. “You could see their faces just change.” The cheese has been entered in the American Cheese Society’s annual competition. held each summer. where cottage cheeses are just beginning to get noticed. Last year. Traderspoint Creamery in Indiana and Cabot Creamery in Vermont entered. Cabot took second place in one of the society’s fresh. unripened cheese categories. Cottage cheese is also nudging its way into the winners’ circle at the World Cheese Awards. the largest cheese event in the world. At the 2017 competition in London in November. cottage cheeses from Spain and Luxembourg took silver awards. and two others from Spain and Austria won bronze awards. To be sure. cottage cheese and its pressed cousins like paneer and queso fresco remain more popular in other countries. And in March. Tablet Magazine included cottage cheese on its list of the 100 most Jewish foods. Rekindling the love affair may be wishful thinking. There are a lot people who just are never going to like cottage cheese. One is Kevin Pang. a food writer in Chicago who recently wrote of his revulsion for The Takeout. a food website affiliated with The Onion. “There’s something about its connotation with cellulite.” he says in an interview. And then there’s the texture. “Us Chinese. we love the slippery and the slimy. like tendon and jelly fish.” he says. “But cottage cheese. man. I just can’t do it. And I’ve eaten horse.” Even Ed Townley. chief executive officer of Cabot. isn’t convinced that cottage cheese is poised for a comeback. even though his company makes about £5m a year. Like Pang. he singles out texture. Perhaps cottage cheese could be whipped to smooth it out. or made more spreadable. like ricotta cheese. he says. And then there is the name. “It conjures up this old-fashioned image where you think of a cottage.” he says. “Bottom line. it’s not sexy. A very clever Turkish name or something would go a long way.”
lifestyle,ARE YOU IGNORING MY MESSAGE?,The inexorable rise of technology has brought with it many new and difficult questions that humanity is struggling to answer. Is technology good or bad for us? Is social media addiction fracturing any real sense of community? Will the robots that are already stealing our jobs take over altogether and turn us into meat-based slaves? While you ponder a future in which the toaster sighs as it tells you you’ve bought the wrong sort of bread again and the car has a strop because you insist on back-seat driving even though there’s no longer a steering wheel. there is one question that requires a far more urgent response. Did you get my message? Did you? Only I sent you a text an hour and a half ago and you still haven’t responded. My phone says it was delivered but maybe it didn’t really go through. I’ll try again. Oh. right. So now my phone’s telling me that you did read my first text two minutes after I sent it yet you still haven’t replied. Seriously? How long does it take to type “OK”?  Why haven’t you got back to me? Are you ignoring me? Have you dumped me? What’s going on? Are you dead? Of course. what really happened is that the recipient read your text as they were boarding the Eurostar at St Pancras International en route to a summit dedicated to generally saving the earth. They couldn’t get a signal for the first 20 minutes of their journey (that fast bit from London to the coast is a cell-hole). Then they thought their answer had gone through when it hadn’t. They didn’t notice “message not sent” until they’d got to France and then they weren’t sure whether sending you a text from the continent would cost a tenner (it won’t. At least not before Brexit). So. long story short. they thought they would wait until they got to the hotel and had wifi. so they could send a free WhatsApp. In the meantime. you’ve gone from asking “do you want to come to supper?” to “are you seeing someone else?” faster than you can get from Oxford Street to the Champs-Élysées on a day the SNCF isn’t striking.  In the olden days. before most households even had answer-machines. it was much harder to feel rejected. If the person you were waiting to hear from didn’t call when you hoped they would. you could kid yourself that they must have tried during that 10-minute interval while you were at the corner shop. The answer-machine was the beginning of the end of those halcyon days of telephonic ignorance but even then you could tell yourself that your flatmate might have accidentally erased your beloved’s message from the tape. There was simply no way of knowing for sure… Until the advent of BT’s 1471. which could tell you exactly who called while you were out buying cigarettes. However even then that “number not available” still might have been the love of your life rather than someone asking whether you’d had an accident. right? Nobody calls anymore. of course. While as of 2016. more than three quarters of the UK adult population owned smart phones. less than a quarter ever used them to make actual old-fashioned voice calls. Daisy Buchanan explained the millennial point of view. “We’re in touch with each other constantly. but written communication allows us to participate in the conversation at the pace we choose. We don’t have to worry about misreading anyone’s tone when the words are laid out in black and white.” “Don’t have to worry about misreading?” As someone who insists on using grammar in texts and has never knowingly texted “U OK hun?” even when my other half has ignored five texts in a row. I would argue she is dead wrong about that. Tone is impossible to guess in a text. Hence the rise of the GIF. in which little films of people using expressions you might once have seen on someone’s actual face in a real time face-to-face conversation explain everything you really need to know about that horrible one word answer “fine”.  But let’s go back to what happens when there are no words whatsoever “laid out in black and white”. Text messages and emails have quickly become the preferred communication media of people who hate to offend. Want to ask a difficult question? There’s no longer any need to do it in person. Stick it in a WhatsApp. Don’t want to answer that difficult question? Pretend you never even saw it.  However. when you’re on the receiving end of the textual equivalent of the silent treatment. you can no longer pretend it’s not happening. Apple has robbed us of the comfort of denial now messages come with those dreaded tags “delivered” and “read”. which are automatically enabled on iPhone. Those tags have given rise to the term “leaving me on read”. meaning that you’re being ignored and you know it. Perhaps even worse is Apple’s “typing awareness indicator” – that bubble with the dots in it – which lets you know when someone was going to respond to you but ultimately decided not to press “send”.  Think you’re being diplomatic by not getting back to that overly-persistent friend? The Harley Therapy company website has “you ignore texts. emails or even conversations” at number eight in their top 10 signs that you’re being passive-aggressive. Dr Jean Twenge. author of Generation Me. sees both sides of the equation. In defence of the non-responders. she told Elle’s Alyssa Bailey. “When you’re already worried and stressed out. you probably don’t want to subject yourself to the worry and stress of telling someone ‘no’. so the easy way out is instead to ignore.”  However. for those of us waiting. she adds that not responding is “not always a kind way to behave. You’re not really taking the other person’s perspective. thinking what it’s like for the other person to wait.” Waiting for a response and turning the possible reasons why that response is not forthcoming while you do so (aka ruminating) is “one of the biggest risk factors for depression”. In fact. recent studies have shown that not responding to someone’s effort to communicate can cause actual changes in the ignored person’s brain. The anterior cingulate cortex. the part of the brain responsible for detecting pain. is activated by feeling excluded. Long-term activation of this brain structure can manifest itself in physical symptoms such as tiredness. headaches and even IBS. The more important to us the person ignoring us is. the more extreme the effects. No wonder “the silent treatment” is considered by many medical professionals to be a form of psychological abuse. In 1901. when you could still use “that carrier pigeon must have been shot” as an excuse for not getting a message. George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Devil’s Disciple that. “The worst sin to our fellow creatures is not to hate them. but to be indifferent to them: that is the essence of inhumanity”. Shaw was right. If taking 10 seconds (or less) to respond “OK” to an irritating text can prevent your partner. mother. friend or boss from going into a serious decline. isn’t it something worth doing?
lifestyle,Australian cities are lagging behind in greening up their buildings,Covering roofs and walls of buildings with vegetation is a good way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And these green roofs and walls make cities look nicer. Toronto’s central business district adopted a policy of establishing green roofs on around half of all city buildings in 2009. Research shows this could reduce maximum city temperatures by up to 5C. We spent the past 12 months analysing the case for more greenery on Australian city buildings. drawing on international comparisons. We’ve shown that a mandatory policy. coupled with incentives to encourage new and retrofitted green roofs and walls. will provide environmental. social and business benefits. These include improved air quality. energy conservation and reductions in storm water runoff from buildings. which would decrease flash flooding. Green roofs and walls also become new habitats for biodiversity and can be pleasant spaces for social interaction in dense urban areas. We found numerous studies confirming that greenery on inner city buildings reduces the urban heat island effect. which is when city centres are hotter than surrounding suburban and outer urban areas. We found numerous studies confirming that greenery on inner city buildings reduces the urban heat island effect. which is when city centres are hotter than surrounding suburban and outer urban areas. We examined international case studies of cities embracing green roofs and walls to review policy frameworks which could be suitable for Australia. A range of measures and policies exist and vary depending on building types (buildings need specific features to host vegetation) and the degree to which policies can be enforced. Singapore is leading in this area. It markets itself as a “garden city” to attract investment. visitors and commerce. Green roofs and walls are a vital and visual manifestation of this policy. Greenery is ingrained in Singapore’s development sector and is boosted by incentives. grants. awards. certification schemes and government led development. Through this voluntary-heavy (yet supported) effort. Singapore increased its number of green roofs and spaces ninefold between 2006 and 2016. Rotterdam’s efforts weren’t as extensive as Singapore’s. but the city more than doubled its green roof area from 2012-2017 through incentives. grants. tax benefits and demonstration projects. London increased its total green roof area more than fourfold from 2005-2016. This was partially achieved through a biodiversity action plan. And Toronto has the second largest area of green roofs of the four cities we studied. This has been delivered through a mandatory policy. introduced in 2009. that requires all new developments with roofs of 2.000 square metres or more to install green roofs. We modelled what could be delivered in Sydney and Melbourne based on the measures taken in Singapore (which is voluntary-heavy). London (voluntary-light). Rotterdam (voluntary-medium) and Toronto (mandatory). We combined this with data on actual green building projects in 2017 in Sydney and Melbourne to show the potential increase of projects in each city based on the four policies. In the Sydney local government area. 123 green roof and wall projects were under way in 2016. In the Melbourne local government area. 28 green roof and wall projects were under way. Sydney and Melbourne have green roof and green wall policies aligned with their 2030 and 2040 sustainability targets. launched in 2012 and 2015 respectively. Sydney has the Green Roofs and Walls Policy Implementation Plan. while Melbourne has the Growing Green Guide 2014. These policies appear most aligned with the voluntary-light approach adopted in London. Sydney had a 23 per cent increase in green roofs since its policy launch. although this was from a very low starting point. Melbourne also reports an increase in green roofs and walls. though the amount of uptake isn’t publicly available. There are. of course. barriers to greening up buildings. These include costs as well as lack of experience in the industry. especially in terms of construction and management. Professional capacity for green roofs is still in a developing phase and further training and skill development are needed. Around 87 per cent of the building stock Australia will have in 2050 is already here. and a large proportion of existing buildings could be retrofitted. We recommend a voluntary approach using a mix of initiatives for building owners. such as tax benefits and credits in green building tools. Focusing on new buildings is likely to lead to more modest growth rates in the short to medium term. relative to alternative approaches such as retrofitting. The annual growth rate of new stock is around 1-3 per cent. which means that policies focusing on new stock will have a substantial impact over the long term. However. in the short to medium term. a retrofit policy would have greater impact given the numbers of existing buildings suitable for this. Local government areas can also promote the evidence showing the lift in property values in areas with more green infrastructure – in some instances up to 15 per cent. This should encourage voluntary uptake.
lifestyle,WHY CAMPING BECOMES FAR MORE ENJOYABLE IN ADULTHOOD,If I have an abiding memory of spending time on campsites as a child it is one thing. Sitting in the laundrette. the rain beating down outside. watching our trainers going round and round in the washing machine. having been muddied to unrecognisable proportions by a day yomping around a sodden Lake District. I vividly remember one of those summers. when I was probably just nine or ten. seeing a double decker bus with an advert for Malta on the side. It seemed impossibly distant and exotic. but I would go there. one day. I vowed. I would not spend my adult summers trudging under slate-grey skies towards mountains wreathed in dank cloud. that never seemed to get any closer. I would stay in a hotel! On those childhood holidays we had a caravan. a thing so small we christened it The Boiled Egg. because it had the appearance and rough dimensions of one. In The Boiled Egg and its associated awning and adjacent tents. we looked like a down-at-heel circus had arrived. There was me. my mum and dad. my auntie and uncle. and my cousins. The Boiled Egg never went anywhere exciting. not to a child. The Lake District and Wales. mainly. One time. our carnivalesque convoy travelled to the land of the Red Dragon. We took several wrong turns in those far-off. pre-satnav days. and made several circuits around Mold. so many that on the first we saw a wedding party going into a church and on the last saw them emerge.  Finally we got on the right road… or. right-ish. We ended up driving so far up a mountain that we could actually see climbers below us. pointing up in amazement at The Boiled Egg going where no caravan. even one of such tiny stature. had any right to be. We ended up at a campsite in a place called Dinas Dinlle. which sounded like something from the Lord of the Rings. which I was devouring at the time. and felt like the end of the earth. I only mention all this because you’d expect. from these experiences. that I would eschew any form of camping at the earliest opportunity and refuse to go on any holiday that did not involve four solid walls and a roof on which the ceaseless rain did not sound like a drum solo. And. for many years. that was the case. But somehow. over the past decade. I seem to have not only found myself camping again – and proper camping. under canvas – but doing so not with a sense of fatalism. but with an enthusiasm my younger self would be appalled at. The first camping trip of modern times was borne out of necessity. The children were young. aged perhaps eight and six. and our finances would not run to anything more extravagant. We booked a week in Wales. in a kill-or-cure way of thinking. Our tent was all wrong. we had as much rain as you might expect in Wales (but also some absolutely scorching days) and there was no electricity. This was back in 2011. can you believe I didn’t charge my phone for a whole week? But it was also bloody marvellous. mainly because the kids utterly enjoyed it so much. The campsite was a quirky affair. built by an old hippy and featuring odd little installations such as its own stone circle and a bank of seats procured at some point from an old airplane. We were – and this is the crucial part my parents would have done well to understand when we used to tromp around the fells and dales of Cumbria – in striking distance of some gorgeous beaches. It wasn’t by any means a perfect camping experience. but somehow over the course of those seven days. we got hooked. The following year we got bolder. We decided to go to Cornwall. near to St Ives. We bought a bigger tent. In fact. we upgraded considerably. The campsite had a swimming pool. There was an electric hook-up. We were on some of the most stunning coastline in the world. And that fortnight is when we fell very. very hard for camping. We were pushed over the edge by glorious. almost Mediterranean weather. by the fact we were so close to one of the UK’s tourist hotspots without paying the eye-watering prices asked for hotels or holiday lets in high season. and by virtue of shelling out an arm and a leg for a huge tent that was almost. if not quite literally. a home from home. But it was also a sense of freedom that had been lacking from my childhood holidays. or perhaps not so much lacking as less noticeable. When you’re a kid you roam everywhere – or at least you did back then – and are rarely indoors in the summer months. Holidays merely transplanted that to another part of the country for a week or two. But as an adult. especially one who has worked for decades. day in. day out in offices. suddenly waking up to the sound of birds singing and stepping out on to dewy grass. drinking coffee from plastic mugs under blue skies and feeling at one with. well. maybe not untrammelled nature but at least a carefully manicured campsite pitch… that is remarkably rejuvenating. much more so than sleeping in a hotel or apartment. We resolved immediately to return to Cornwall the following year. After all. camping was so easy! You just packed up the car and went! Granted. the first year. in Wales. we’d merely loaded up the boot with our modest tent and meagre kit. The first trip to Cornwall had involved the purchase of a roof box for the car. because our new tent was a lot bigger. Little did we know that once the camping bug had well and truly bitten. things were going to get a little more complicated. If you ever feel short of shopping opportunities. get into camping. There’s a whole world of conspicuous consumption awaiting you in the outdoor and camping shops dotted up and down the country. We acquired a table. chairs. outdoor furniture. Solar-powered fairy lights around the entrance to your tent are de rigueur. as are windbreaks to mark out your fiefdom. A gas cooker. kettle. pots and pans. There are things you didn’t know you couldn’t in all conscience go on a camping holiday without. Who knew an inflatable sofa would prove so indispensable? Could we possibly conceive of a tent without fitted carpets these days? We are not. it has to be said. campers who rough it. Nor would I necessarily put us into the “glamping” bracket. a term which I still reserve for people who camp in pre-erected yurts with private toilet blocks. The acquisition of all this stuff necessitated the borrowing. for a couple of years. of a trailer from my uncle. Then we bought our own. We’ve just got rid of it and are this year going to hire a trailer twice the size. because last year we bought a new. bigger tent that inflates instead of using tent poles. Seriously. once you try one of those you’ll never go back to staring at a series of metal tubes on the grass wondering which one goes with which. Apart from writing pieces like this. I’m not very evangelical about camping. I know it isn’t for everyone. A lot of people don’t like the idea of having to go to a shower block in the middle of the night for a wee. And I’m not going to pretend it’s perfect. all the time. Last year we put up our tent in a thunderstorm. There’s nothing worse than finding out your tent has got so old it leaks during a downpour and gets all your clothes wet. There can be stress when you realise that on the day of leaving your holiday you’ve got about two hours to put away everything that took you a whole day to carefully pack for the journey down. Over the years we’ve had to leave behind an astonishingly frightening amount of stuff that just would not go back in the car. But the kids. as sophisticated as they are these days. still love that almost primal sense of freedom camping gives. They can roam around. we can enjoy a glass of chilled wine (we have an electric fridge. of course) in the sunshine. The campsite we use is stuffed with facilities. and while it. and buying the kit. isn’t cheap. it’s still a fraction of the price we’d pay to holiday within bricks-and-mortar in St Ives at that time of year. Camping holidays were a necessity when they started. but now they are a choice. In the years between my childhood holidays and our latest camping adventures. I have been to many places across the world. but I have never been to the dream-like Malta that was so inviting on the side of that bus when I was a kid. Perhaps I will. one day. but certainly for now. I’m determined to carry on camping.
lifestyle,Eight reasons I’ll never move back to America now that I’m in Canada,We all have that person in our family: the gregarious relative who slaps you on the back. laughs too loudly. and somehow takes up all the space in whatever room (s)he happens to inhabit. In the world order. that relation is the United States. I live in Canada. the soft-spoken. more respectful. more tactful cousin. with whom you have a surprisingly great conversation and can't wait to see again. Before anyone assumes that I fled the US due to the recent political strife. I've been gone for a decade. I left for love in 2008. right as the world was falling off a precipice due to the financial crisis. Initially. the plan was to stay for a year or two. but the longer I stayed. the deeper my roots here grew. and the more the US feels like a place to which I can never return. Here are some of the things that keep me tied to the Great White North: The politics are quieter I can engage in political discussion with people holding opposing viewpoints without it turning into a character assassination of ourselves or politicians (for the most part). The pre-election campaign cycles are much shorter. and there are five active political parties. Politics are still politics. but most of the time. it's not incredibly sensational. Their borders seem more open to me The world is faced with a migrant crisis. and Canada is committed to opening that golden door so the huddled masses come to breathe free. Rather than just providing charity for refugees and immigrants. Canada's goal is to solve labour shortages and wants to bolster the population to power the economy for years to come. As an immigrant. being given the chance to have a positive economic impact and contribute to a thriving society is much appreciated. They have a cross-country train Like in the States. train travel is expensive. But both the Trans Canada Railway and VIA Rail offer options to take you coast to coast. giving people a way to see a large swath of the country. This one's on my bucket list. They have pseudo-socialised health care. Contrary to popular rhetoric. healthcare in Canada is not free; it's funded through a combination of personal and corporate taxation. But as long as you have your health card. you don't have to pay for the most basic services. including doctor visits. ultrasounds. and hospital stays. (Well. unless you want a private room. That will cost extra.) For the most part. guns are for hunting There are plenty of guns in Canada. Yes. some of them are used for violent crime and there aren't strict gun regulations in place. but the culture around guns doesn't seem as fanatical (yet). For reference. Canada has 5.1 gun-related homicides per million people. America has 29.7. according to Vox. I like their money No more worrying about taping that bill back together - the bills are made of polymer. The newest design also features a person of colour - civil rights activist Viola Desmond... And the currency has fun nicknames. The dollar bill and two dollar bill are coins. nicknamed the Loonie and the Toonie. Poutine is seriously amazing It's not just cheese and gravy on French fries. The secret lies in the cheese curds. the fresh. squeaky bits of curdled milk. While some Canadians think any variation is sacrilege. lobster poutine is pretty divine. They are on their way to legalised recreational marijuana Whatever your thoughts about using marijuana. it's a fact that criminalising usage is expensive for courts and law enforcement. Legalisation is scheduled for October in Canada.
lifestyle,IS IT EVER OK TO ASK SOMEONE IF THEY ARE SINGLE?,“Are you single?” This is exciting. Why are they asking? Do they want to know if you’re unattached so they can ask you out on a date? Or is it just small talk again? It’s a fairly innocuous question. isn’t it? Are you single? Or the flip side. are you married? It’s the kind of thing you ask someone you’ve met at a party after “what’s your name?” and “where do you come from?” It’s impossible to cause offence by asking someone whether or not they have a partner. surely… Are you mad? Once again. the problem with the question is in the answer. What are they going to do with it once they find out? Let’s take it from there. “Yes. I’m single.” you respond. casually stroking your moustache. “Are you busy this weekend?” they reply. “I need a date for a party on a yacht moored in Monaco. Blumenthal’s doing the food. Sheeran’s doing the music. We’re getting there by private jet. Just bring your swimming costume.” That would be your best case scenario (except perhaps for the Sheeran). More likely. as has frequently happened to me since I’ve looked old enough to sign a register. the person asking the question puts their head on one side and gives a smile that says not “fantastic. now I can make my move” but “I wonder what’s wrong with you?” (It was probably the moustache). Since Noah shuffled all the animals except the manmade ones* onto the Ark. mammals have been going two-by-two. Admitting that you’re without a “better half”. or even “a half you would push under a bus if you thought no one was looking”. generally elicits pity and not a little distrust. You feel it even at an actual singles’ night. where people without partners. who are supposedly looking for love. approach potential dates in a spirit of anxious trepidation. each convinced they’re the only person in the room who is single by circumstance and not because they’re a potential bunny boiler. To be single is to be suspicious. And yet the number of people living alone is very much on the rise. The Office of National Statistics calculated that almost eight million people were living alone in the UK last year. The ONS further estimates that by 2020. the number of households where people live alone will increase by another two million. That’s an awful lot of weirdoes. Or widows. Widowers. Divorcees. Single people who haven’t started looking. Single people who are actively looking. And single people who’ve looked and decided they don’t actually want to be in a relationship at all. That’s a pretty broad group to consider somehow lacking. Yet we do make judgements based on people’s relationships or lack of them and the most prevalent assumption is that coupled up is better. “Four legs good. two legs bad.” to borrow a phrase from Snowball in Orwell’s Animal Farm. (Six legs is something else entirely.) Fortunately. in a work context. it’s illegal to discriminate against someone just because they don’t have a romantic partner. Questions about marital status are among those proscribed by the Equality Act of 2010. An interviewer should never ask if you’re single. That said. “singlism” is rife in the workplace with a recent study of 25.000 workers by Opportunity Now. finding that two thirds of those without families reported they were expected to work longer hours than colleagues with partners and children. Likewise. single workers complain that they have to provide holiday cover for those with families. And when they do get to go on holidays. they’re hit with the dreaded single supplement of course. Being single definitely isn’t the cheaper option and it’s not just single supplements on your holiday accommodation versus the married person’s tax break. Many things are more expensive when you’re on your own. While officially your employer can’t discriminate against you for not having a partner. insurers certainly discriminate based on relationship status. The Comparethemarket.com website puts it this way. “Marriage symbolises so many things. not least it demonstrates that you’re responsible and care enough about another human being not to do anything crazy or reckless.” Which equals lower insurance premiums for the coupled up. I’ve seen it in action. A few years ago. having accrued a few points on my licence for speeding (Not clever. I know). I was having a hell of a time finding someone to insure my Fiat Panda for less than a hundred million pounds. A friend suggested I add him to my insurance application as an extra driver. The cost immediately dropped by nearly two hundred quid. Since the website hadn’t at that point asked for any details beyond his name. I can only assume that an algorithm decided my friend was my partner and he’d be sitting beside me whenever I got behind the wheel. tutting and scowling if I went over 30 in a 50 zone. Surely by the same token. I’d be just as likely to go crazy. put my foot down and run every red light on the south circular every time the controlling bastard wasn’t in the car? It doesn’t make a lot of sense. Technically. single people may have more car accidents but that statistic must be skewed by all the newly licensed 17 year olds who aren’t married because they’re still at school. Age and experience is the factor there. Not whether “you’re responsible and care enough about another human being not to do anything crazy or reckless”. Crazy and reckless like marry the wrong person because all your mates are coupled up and you feel like the odd one out? Marriage might just as well equal desperation. depression and a desire to divorce as stability. While divorce is generally on the decline. that might be due more to the fact that in the current economic climate people simply can’t afford to split a household rather than because we’re getting better at relationships. And when people do get divorced. they’re no longer in such a rush to couple up again. At least. the women aren’t. A recent survey showed that fewer than half of female divorcees would be willing to tie the knot again. To quote Shakespeare. Gandhi and the Dalai Lama (according to the internet). “there’s nothing lonelier than being with the wrong person”. Exactly. I’ll leave the last word on the question “are you single” to this unattributed quote (found on a Pinterest board). which might come in handy next time that bore breathing whisky hears you answer “yes” and suggests it’s because you’re being picky or not making enough of an effort (it’s that moustache again). “Stop asking why I’m still single and I won’t ask why you’re still married.” *The “manmade animals”. A friend’s step-mother. a devout denier of evolution. answered her son’s question about how big the ark would have had to be to get all the world’s creatures on board by explaining that some of the animals were in fact manmade and thus not around in Noah’s time. She didn’t specify the animals in question. but my friend and I concluded they must include the duck-billed platypus and the aye-aye. I mean. come on. they were clearly both invented in the course of a drinking game.
lifestyle,Living the expat life in Sanya,Sanya. on the southern tip of China’s Hainan island. is already proving a popular destination for European holiday makers. But some foreigners are also coming to make it their home. And these expats work in all sorts of industries ranging from tourism to teaching. Twenty-nine-year-old Charlotte Magnette is the General Manager of DreamArt Photography. She's a long way from her homeland. Originally from Belgium. she studied Chinese in Beijing before moving to Sanya. She now runs a company specialising in wedding photography which is a booming industry on the island. but she's introduced her own European twist. "In general what we are trying to do is to take this very traditional Chinese pre-wedding photography. with all the dresses. and bring it a more French touch. a more European touch and fashion into it.” she explains. Charlotte says life is good on Sanya where she can use her language and creative skills. It's also a place she enjoys exploring in her free time. “I love the fact that it’s a very complete place. On one hand. you have the ocean. the beautiful beaches. then you have an actual city with a city centre. where you can actually do things." she says. " And then. at the same time. you have the mountains. with tropical rainforests and a lot of nature. so I think it’s super-complete.” Godfrey Zwygart is another European expat who’s made Sanya his home. He’s from France. and served in the French Navy. He has now been in Sanya for nine years overseeing the development of the Serenity Marina from scratch. When he arrived in Sanya. the marina did not even exist. Now it is full of luxury yachts and has become a focal point for the area. "For people of Sanya and people of China. they come over for holidays. enjoy the sunset. enjoy the beach. enjoy the watersports.” he explains. "We also host a lot of international races." In fact. the Marina’s hosted The Ocean Race - regarded as sailing's greatest round-the-world event. Godfrey believes Sanya has made tremendous improvements in the last 10 years. "It’s developing so fast." he says. "It’s really comparable to the Riviera. we are the new Cannes of China.” And when it's time to chill. there is plenty to do in Sanya. “Looking for some good restaurants. good food with friends. going to a bar from time to time." he explains. "It’s a very good life you know. it’s a very laid-back life here in Sanya. It’s quite enjoyable.” Godfrey and Charlotte are part of a much bigger expat community. Romanians. French. British. Russians and Ukrainians often come together for a game of football. Henry Green is a teacher from Milton Keynes in the UK. He's a keen football player. “You can’t complain about working on a tropical island. And the football’s great." he says. "You can come here. you can meet people from all different countries. like Chinese. Russian. French. and regardless if you speak the same language. you can just come together for the common language of football.” Bo Guan. a tour guide for Sanya Holiday International Travel Agency. agrees: "Taking time out of our busy schedules is not only about exercising. but also helping foreigners better integrate into Sanya life and culture. China is a country of friendship. so it's right to help each other." It appears expats clearly enjoy their jobs and are making the most of living on this paradise island.
lifestyle,Madonna is frequently hours late for concerts. a fan says. He's suing.,A Florida man has filed a class-action lawsuit against Madonna after a concert he planned to attend in Miami Beach was pushed back by two hours to accommodate the pop star's tardiness. Nate Hollander purchased three tickets totaling $1.024.95 for Madonna's Dec. 17. 2019. "Madame X Tour" at the Fillmore Miami Beach concert venue. according to the suit filed Nov. 4 in federal court in Miami-Dade County. At the time Hollander bought the tickets. the show was scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m.. according to the suit against the pop star and concert promoter Live Nation. The suit alleges at the start of the tour. which kicked off in September. Madonna repeatedly arrived hours late to her shows. The singer. 61. has a "long history of arriving and starting her concerts late" and to accommodate her tardiness the Miami Beach show was rescheduled to start at 10:30 p.m.. the complaint states. Hollander did not want to attend a concert that late and Live Nation would not refund him his money. according to the lawsuit. "Ticketholders had to work and go to school the next day. which prevented them from attending a concert that would end at around 1:00 a.m.." the suit claims. "Hollander attempted. without success. to obtain a refund for the three tickers purchased for the Madonna concert." In an attempt to recover some of the money he spent. Hollander used Ticketmaster to resell the concert tickets. "Due to the change in the start times ... all tickets purchased by Hollander and all class members suffered an extreme loss in value. making it impossible for Hollander and all class members to recover the amount paid for said tickets by reselling them." according to the lawsuit. Hollander is suing for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation and is seeking damages. He claims Madonna and Live Nation "knew or should have known that said concerts would not start at 8:30 p.m." due to her showing up late to previous shows. Madonna and Live Nation could not immediately be reached for comment on the lawsuit. According to KVVU in Las Vegas. fans reportedly booed Madonna and chanted they wanted a refund after a show Thursday at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace started two hours late. The outlet reported that the concert was scheduled to start at 10:30 p.m. but the singer did not hit the stage until 12:30 a.m. Madonna addressed the crowd in a video she posted on Twitter early Saturday morning. "Here's something that you all need to understand. And that is. that a queen is never late." she said as she sat on top of a piano. She captioned the video "F.A.C.T.S." with a crown emoji and the hashtags "#madamextheatre #thecolosseum." The Madame X Tour ends in March 2020 with stops in Los Angeles. Boston. Philadelphia and in Europe.
lifestyle,London's National Gallery displays single Da Vinci painting in 'immersive' exhibition,Legendary Italian painter. scientist and inventor Leonardo Da Vinci died 500 years ago. Now the National Gallery in London is exhibiting one of his paintings in a novel way by recreating its original setting. "The Virgin of the Rocks" was first displayed in a church in Milan that has since been destroyed. Da Vinci spent around 25 years working on the painting and completed it in around 1508. "The idea is to use immersive experience and to use digital technology to explore this great masterpiece." the gallery's director Gabriele Finaldi said. "We take the public on a journey through the spaces that Leonardo was familiar with. through the landscapes he was familiar with. His interest in light and optics. the church for which he painted the picture that no longer exists. and the altar piece. we make an evocation of the original setting of the painting". High-tech mapping and spectral imaging of the Virgin have revealed a different composition from the one Da Vinci began. But he mysteriously abandoned it for the version that can be seen today. "He makes two-dimensional form seem three-dimensional and alive. and he does that through his great studies of optics." the exhibition's curator Caroline Campbell said. "He is someone who at the time he's working at this painting. is understanding that we see through different points. we see light in different ways." Leonardo has long been considered by many the ultimate Renaissance genius. His paintings include the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper" but he's thought to have only completed about twenty paintings.

lifestyle,Did you know Dubai is fifth most instagrammed city in the world?,Dubai has been named the 5th most Instagrammed city in the world in a survey by travel site Wego. From its sweeping beaches. to standout architecture and world class restaurants. there’s a photo opportunity to be found at every landmark and for every occasion. In fact. food is one of the main reasons for visiting the city. Dubai led the way in the 'food' category for Instagram hashtags with a massive 26 per cent of all hashtags in or including Dubai also including food. This summer alone there were 79 million hashtags related to Dubai. Some of the hotspots include the city’s Miracle Garden which is the largest flower garden in the world. It has 72.000 square metres with over 50 million blooming flowers. As well as the Miracle Garden. downtown Dubai is also home to the Burj Khalifa which is also one of the top five most instagrammed places in the city. And in the city’s centrally located Zabeel Park you can find Dubai Frame. an architectural landmark. This 150-metre-high. 93-metre-wide structure is positioned so that visitors can soak in the views of modern Dubai to the south and old Dubai to the north. Mamoun Hmedan. Managing Director. MENA and India. Wego says the ranking is a huge achievement for Dubai. “Dubai is the one and only Arab city that’s ranked within the top five. That’s a lot for one city compared to very well-established tourism destinations.” he says. The top city in terms of hashtags was London with 118 million posts. Next was Paris with 101 million. followed by Nice and New York who received 87 million and 83 million respectively. Other top hashtags include Istanbul. Jakarta. Los Angeles. Barcelona. Moscow. and Tokyo. Sarah Hedley Hymers is a travel journalist and social media influencer. She says putting photos on Instagram is all about social capital. “You want to present something that is aspirational." she explains. "It has to be well-framed. It has to be colourful – dark pictures don’t do so well on Instagram. So. you’re looking for something that is bright. that really pops and that makes people think ‘urgh. I wish I was there’. It’s the postcard of now!” The social media app is redefining the travel industry. A number of studies show 'Instagrammability' is a key factor younger travellers - especially millennials - look for when choosing where to go on holiday and spend their money. Sarah Hedley-Hymers believes millennials are the digital generation. She says they are not just tech- savvy they are tech-dependent. "They see WiFi as their oxygen. so all of their decisions are formed by the internet and social media. not just where to travel. but what diet to eat etc." she explains. "So it’s not surprising that millennials will look to Instagram. But also. Instagram is hugely functional. It’s so much more functional than print. which is inconvenient to carry. or a website which has corporate functions like booking forms and company bios. It’s picture led and it has concise captions.” In fact. studies show 41% of people under the age of 33 prioritise 'Instagramability' when selecting their destination. And it’s a market the industry is keen to capitalise on. “They want places they can basically take with them. put it on social media. share it with friends. keep it as a memory. create their own moment where they feel that they made it and nobody else could make it. " says Mamoun Hmedan. "So. it’s completely different. everything is digital for them obviously That’s the growing sector within the tourism industry in general and it’s going to keep leading the way for at least 20 or 30 years.” It appears Instagram is the go-to platform to get a snapshot into the life of the hashtag savvy traveller.

lifestyle,Time with the best: Vienna Philharmonic's mastery passed to Peruvian protégés,"To be in Salzburg is a dream come true." said Matías Montalvan. a young violinist from Peru. Matías is part of “Sinfonía por el Perú” - a project created eight years ago by Tenor Juan Diego Flórez which offers free music education to disadvantaged children. The foundation has taught thousands of young people a musical instrument or taught them to sing in a choir. The main youth philharmonic orchestra (fifty of the group) went to Salzburg. to learn first hand from the best. from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Euronews went to find out how they got on. "I wanted to show them all my inner emotions through my instrument" Nicole Revoredo is a double bass player with the Sinfonía por el Peru and she said. "When the musicians from Vienna came to see the orchestra rehearsal I was very nervous but at the same time I really wanted to show them all my inner emotions. through my instrument." Flórez said it was amazing to work with the young musicians. "The idea that an orchestra can mentor another one is such a powerful one because not only the orchestra is nurturing and mentoring another one but also the work they do individually with the kids is really fantastic." Unique mentorship programme With this unique mentorship programme Flórez is taking his social initiative to the next level. Ten members of the iconic Vienna Philharmonic worked in intensive orchestra workshops and masterclasses with the young musicians. to pass on their knowledge. values. and traditions. Michael Bladerer. Managing Director. Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra said. "We. the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. are famous for our uniqueness. We not only have special instruments. but we also have our own sound. We have our own ideas of the tradition of sound. in particular concerning the phrasing. articulation. and intonation. I believe that it is very interesting for all these young people to take away something from this experience." "The most inspiring was the fire that they have. the thirst for knowledge. questions on top of questions and also the gratitude they had and how they took on my ideas." said Thomas Lechner. Timpanist. Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. "We felt a gigantic adrenaline rush because they watched us playing and this is an incredible privilege." added Nicole. One-to-one tuition from the best Nicole and Matias had the chance to work in a one-to-one lesson with the masters. "I felt that I was progressing a lot. I worked hard and I discovered things that I wouldn't have seen by myself. I have learned that music is a universal and unique language." said Matías. Benjamin Morrison. Violinist. Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra gave this advice to Matías. "Don't give up. even if it's difficult. always keep within you the passion that you have for music and the discipline to make it even better." Bladerer gave good guidance to Nicole. "You have to practice. again. again and again." The orchestra continues to dream big with concerts around the world on the horizon. "What we are here for is the transformation of society through music but if music can be excellent. then it's even better." added Flórez.
lifestyle,Who's a good boy? US won't name dog that helped catch ISIS leader,Who's a good dog? The military won't say. but here's the first look at the hero pooch. The dog that was injured in the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is back with his handler and recuperating from his injuries. Pentagon officials said. President Donald Trump released a photo of the dog later Monday. On Sunday. he hailed the dog's actions while describing the Saturday evening raid — but did not reveal any specifics about the courageous canine's identity. Two U.S. officials told NBC News that the breed of the dog is a Belgian Malinois. "We are not releasing the name of the dog right now." the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Gen. Mark A. Milley. told reporters at a briefing Monday. "We're protecting his identity." The dog was chasing al-Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel when the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest. killing himself and three of his children. The dog suffered unspecified injuries. "Our 'K-9.' as they call it." Trump said. "I call it a dog. A beautiful dog — a talented dog — was injured and brought back." Trump. the first president not to have a pet in the White House in more than a century. has repeatedly used "dog" as a put down. including in his remarks Sunday. Al-Baghdadi. he said. "died like a dog. He died like a coward." Milley said the unidentified animal was "slightly wounded and fully recovering." and ready to go back to work. "The dog is still in theater. returned to duty with its handler. so we're not going to release just yet photos or names of dogs. or anything else." the general said. adding that "the military working dog performed a tremendous service as they all do in a variety of situations." The K-9s have a tremendous success rate when it comes to targeting terror chiefs. A Belgian Malinois named Cairo accompanied the Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. and reportedly helped guard the perimeter while the SEALs tracked the al Qaeda founder down. Time magazine awarded Cairo its "Animal of the Year" award in 2011 — before his identity was made public. "This heroic dog deserves an extra treat. or twelve." the announcement said.
lifestyle,Global artists celebrate musical freedom at the Baku Jazz Festival,Jazz is all about freedom and absorbing musical influences from around the world. and the Baku Jazz Festival showed very well how an eclectic selection of music could be extremely creative. Musicians from different nationalities and cultural backgrounds worked together at the jam sessions. despite having never met before. and amazed their audiences as they improvised. The event was opened by the Turkish blues and rock band of Feti Çağlayan. but other acts also shone through. Among them was the Freedom Trio. a collective of three musicians from three continents who are now based in Sweden. The Trio of Deodata Siquir from Mozambique. Rubem Farias from Bazil and Steinar Aadnekvam from Norway has performed over a hundred concerts at clubs and festivals across Europe and the US since they came together in 2015. Their second album — titled "Freedoms Trio II” — was released last year. Dutch saxophonist Yuri Honing performed an acoustic quartet with his compatriots Joost Lijbaart on drums and pianist Wolfert Brederode. as well as bass player Gulli Gudmundsson from Iceland. He told Euronews about the many competing influences on his music. "I went from classical music to jazz music. to Arab music for a long time and then pop music for a pretty long time. [then] rock music and now I am blending in everything in." he says. "Of course there are many influences but there should be many influences. it's a nice thing to have many sources to rely on." Future talent The 54 year old started playing the piano when he was five and then switched to saxophone aged 12. He is now considered one of the world's most creative saxophonists. A new album is out next spring. But it's not just about established artists and groups at the Baku Jazz Festival.

lifestyle,Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola praised as he wins Lumière Award,The five-time Oscar winner Francis Ford Coppola accepted the 2019 Lumière Award earlier this month. It was another accolade for the prized director of landmark films including The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Coppola's name joins a succession of big names who have been honoured since the prize was first awarded in 2009. including Clint Eastwood. Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. But he was not the only attraction at this year's Lumière Film Festival in Lyon. with Ken Loach and Donald Sutherland among the star names present. Thierry Frémaux. the director of the festival. said the prize for Coppola was a well-designated honour. "He's a giant. a huge personality. because he's a great director and producer. He's also a winemaker. someone who alternates between extreme independence and the incarnation of great Hollywood adventures. "We live in a time when the person who made the three Godfathers. and Apocalypse Now. and so many other movies. can come and be here with us. to receive the Lumière Award." In keeping with the award's tradition. Coppola was invited to take the director's chair in a remake of the first motion picture ever made. The Lumière brothers' first film La Sortie de l'Usine Lumière à Lyon ("Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory in Lyon") was shot in the city in 1895. and Coppola was at the helm for a recreation from 2019. He also unveiled a plaque in his name on the Wall of Filmmakers. at the Lumière Institute. The festival has become a success in recent years. with over 100.000 spectators and 180 classic films to see this time around. Another attraction was Ken Loach. who drew a large crowd for one of several masterclasses that let the public question filmmakers. His event contained a political debate about Brexit. but the British director tried to emphasise the importance of cinema too. He also showed his new film "Sorry We Missed You". which tells the story of a family whose life is turned upside down when the father takes a job at a home delivery company — which strangely resembles Amazon. French actor and director Daniel Auteuil. whose career spanning nearly half a century covers almost a hundred films to his name. was also honoured. But the festival made a point of including his latest film Belle Epoque. which premiered in Cannes last May and is released in France in November. in the tributes — something the director said he appreciated. Auteuil told Euronews: "I think that a tribute that would have focused only on the past would be very beautiful but it would have made me sad. But here we had a tribute given to me in the present. as my career continues. which is something that I find is encouraging to me." Also in attendance at film festival events were the American actor Frances McDormand. Canada's Donald Sutherland and the Mexican actor-director Gael Garcia Bernal. Another star draw was Bong Joon-Ho. the Korean filmmaker who most recently claimed the Palme d'Or for his film Parasite.
