025a4a4fd516f7ec86eac,025a4a4fd5,How machine learning is changing business communications,Machine learning can also help businesses cope with the always on expectation of customers. Customers expect an immediate answer to a phone call and employees are expected to be by the laptop for conference calls wherever they are working. By handling emails with intelligent automated responses an employee is relieved of at least part of their email influx. Machine learning might also soon be able to tell us whether the customer prefers a call or meeting and when to speak vs. when to listen to a customer on the call. The data will help customer service teams work out what time of day teams need to be on calls and how many employees we need at any one time. Anything that requires the processing of volumes of data to identify patterns could in theory be assisted by machine learning.

0262d88f221700ff4e9dc,0262d88f22,Google Cloud gets a new family of cheaper general purpose compute instances,Google Cloud today announced the launch of its new   family of compute instances. These new instances which are meant for generalpurpose workloads offer a significant cost benefit with saving of around 3125 compared to the current N1 generalpurpose instances.The   family runs on standard Intel and AMD chips but as Google notes they also use a custom CPU scheduler that dynamically maps virtual CPU and memory to physical CPU and memory to maximize utilization. In addition the new system is also smarter about where it places VMs with the added flexibility to move them to other hosts as necessary. To achieve all of this Google built a custom CPU scheduler with significantly better latency guarantees and coscheduling behavior than Linuxs default scheduler. The new scheduler promises submicrosecond wakeup latencies and faster context switching.
